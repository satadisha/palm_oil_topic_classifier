114,Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO),50090000028Es1LAAS,Closed,12/5/2015,,4/6/2017,Peru,"Pucallpa, Ucalayi",Community of Santa Clara de Uchunya; Federation for Native Communities of the Ucayali Region (FECONAU); Institute for Legal Defense (IDL); Forest Peoples Programme (FPP),Plantaciones de Pucallpa S.A.C.,Oil Palm Growers,,,"The company concerned has been clearing community lands and destroying natural forests without any reference to RSPO standards. Aerial imagery and official government reports shows that over 5200 hectares of mostly primary forest has been felled since January 20132. Fire is being used to burn cleared timber and other vegetation. Valuable timber resources have also being sold. Community testimony reveals that the company acquired rights to the respective area without any process of engagement or FPIC with the community. Furthermore, the company has been clearing extensive areas of forest without any engagement with the local communities, laying waste to large areas of forest which the communities use for hunting, fishing and gathering and as a source of medicinal plants and materials for construction, killing local wildlife and destroying their vital habitats. The area in question has been historically occupied by residents and their fore parents and includes the locations of numerous former settlements and farms that have since been left to become fallow. The operations have also extracted large volumes of important construction material from the river Aguaytia outside of the lands claimed by Plantaciones de Pucallpa and in the process used and degraded private tracks made by the community and exhausted the resources that the community depends on for their own constructions. The operations have resulted in the destruction of at least one house owned by a community member and have blocking and despoiled the creeks and rivers which the community relies on for their fishing, bathing and drinking waters. Moreover, company personnel restrict access of community members to the area for hunting, fishing and gathering and other subsistence activities. Community testimony highlights that waste materials are being dumped into the water system and all the main streams in the affected lands are no longer fit for drinking and fishing. These include the rivers Sanuya, Sheringal and Churral amongst others. Official investigations conducted by the Ministry of Agriculturehave determined that Plantaciones de Pucallpa has failed to secure the relevant permits required for forest clearance or to conduct the relevant social and environmental impact assessments. The Ministry has consequently ordered the suspension of the operations. In addition, the community understands that the company hired large numbers of people specifically to occupy the area during the field investigations by local authorities in an attempt to deliberately frustrate these visits. This has resulted in an extremely tense and conflictenvironment in which government representatives have even been threatened by company representatives. The extent of social and environmental devastation caused by these operations and the irregularities in permitting has meant these palm oil developments have become a major national controversy, as can be seen on:Despite the suspension order, the community affirms that the company has been promoting the incursion and invasion of third parties in forested areas in areas adjacent to the area cleared by Plantaciones de Pucallpa with the objective of subsequently acquiring these areas. This has resulted in the national indigenous peoples organisation (AIDESEP) to call for the suspension of all oil palm operations in Peru until contradictions and loopholes in the legal framework are resolvedand for the Congressional Commission of the Amazon and Ecology to establish a high level national taskforce to address the issue of large scale agribusiness and social conflict. Although we in the community have been made aware that the company in question is part of a wider network of companies in Peru known locally as los Malaios (the Malays), which are apparently owned by the same proprietors, it was only recently that we established that it was Plantaciones de Pucallpa that was operating in community lands. It has not been possible to identify the full ownership structure of the company and the exact nature of its links to Malaysian companies as many of these companies are registered in offshore tax havens which require limited disclosure of company information. Nevertheless, as a result of the companys own declarations to the RSPOas well as NGO investigationsit appears that these companies are connected to Asian Plantations which in 2014 was bought by FELDA Global Ventures, a founder member of the RSPO. Having now reviewed, the standards which Plantaciones de Pucallpa should be observing as an RSPO member we note the following serious violations.  New Planting Procedure: The company has conducted their operations without filing any prior notifications with the RSPO, large swathes of primary forest have been cleared and no prior HCV or SEIA assessments have been conducted.  Principle 1. Information about the companys plans and operations have never been shared with the community.  Principle 2. The company has acquired lands customarily owned and used by the community of Santa Clara de Uchunya without their free, prior and informed consent.  Principle 3. The company has not provided mechanisms to resolve any of the problems being caused. The company has failed to comply with national laws prohibiting the conversion of primary forest for agricultural purposes, conversion of forest without the corresponding soil studies, environmental permits or relevant environmental and social impact assessments. The company has violated the property rights of indigenous peoples to their customary lands, their right to the natural resources that guarantee their subsistence, their right to processes of prior consultation and consent, their right to determine their own development paths in addition to many other fundamental rights of indigenous peoples which are obligatory in Peru. 9.  Principle 4. Company operations have destroyed and diverted water courses as well as blocked community access to vital water supplies for fishing and drinking.  Principle 5. No EIA or HCV assessments have been carried out to ensure the protection of the environment, wildlife and the social values of natural ecosystems and mitigate damage. Lands are being cleared with the use of fire.  Principle 6. No participatory SIAs have been carried out. There has been no proper consultation with Santa Clara de Uchunya. Dispute resolution mechanisms are absent. Customary rights have been ignored.  Principle 7. New plantings are being established without ESIAs and HCV assessments, without recognising customary rights and without the communities and indigenous peoples free, prior and informed consent. We here only note the most obvious violations. A more detailed perusal of the RSPO Principles and Criteria shows that there have been multiple violations of many of the Criteria and Indicators associated with the Principles noted above. All these violations of applicable laws are detailed in the Ministry of Agriculture official report referred to in footnote 2 and 3. These obligations flow from ILO Convention 169 and the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of human rights the provisions of which constitute binding obligations for Peru.","2017-12-21: Complaints Panel to close the case. 2017-11-21: Case to be closed. 2017-10-30: Complaints Panel issued aletter in response to the request to publish the investigation report. 2017-08-08: Complainants requested that the independent verification report be made public. 2017-05-31: Secretariat following up with the Complainants. 2017-04-06: An independent investigationwas conducted to verify the allegations against Plantaciones de Pucallpa and to determine if Plantaciones de Pucallpa had cleared forest for its plantation, prior and post to becoming an RSPO member, and if said land included primary forests.

118,Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO),50090000028Es0xAAC,Closed,8/22/2015,,10/12/2015,Papua New Guinea,West New Britain,Zebilon Silingen,New Britain Palm Oil Ltd,Oil Palm Growers,SD GUTHRIE BERHAD,,"SMALL HOLDERS AFFAIRS: The Small Holders Affairs is a Department of the NBPOL who acts as the mediator and watchdog between us the Small Holder Growers and the Company NBPOL. I acknowledge both the Department and the working Personals within the department which they have assisted us throughout the years. But one of the most disgusting thing is when there is a major dispute between the company and the small holder the Department dont hear the grievances of the Small Holder Growers and act as the mediator to bring the issue right up to the management of the company so we can discuss the issue on a round table and come to a compromise for the beneficiary of us all and the Palm Oil Industry. Instead the Department acts as a police to suspend the blocks which are under the allegation or dispute. Even some disputes and grievances applied through the grievance forms are just squeezed and thrown into the trash cans. Also most of the time the Department act as a dictator of the company to deprive the privileges and rights of the small holder grower to speak out on some unfair issues the company is practicing; they implement agendas and ideas for the interest of the Company and undermine the wellbeing and freedom expression and speech from the smallholder growers. BUFFER ZONE EXPLOITATION: THE Company, NBPOL is exploiting the 20 metre buffer zone limit, photos below shown: Kumbango Plantation beside Dagi River bank and clearing for new replant.Our mighty Dagi river has caused enormous flooding, great land mass devastation and erosion due to mass deforestations and buffer zone exploitations. The river itself has gone very tinny, when we were kids, everybody crossed this river only by swimming; but today its only ankle deep, we just walk across it. I usually live just on the other side of this river; this river is my livelihood.WASTE DISPOSAL INTO THE RIVER: Kumbango Plantation workers are dumping waste metal junks and workshop junks into our Dagi river bank. Photos shown below: Workshop waste thrown beside roadside just 20 metres away from our Dagi River Bank.BIO GAS ELECTRICITY POWER PLANT: The company has set up two (2) Bio Gas Electricity Power Plants, one at Mosa Oil Mill, and the other one at Kumbango Oil Mill. The Plants generate enormous supply of electricity which is more than enough to feed the whole province with surplus. The Plants act as the step up electricity supply to the Electricity Commission of PNG which rakes in PGK millions on a monthly basis. We the Small Holder Growers are being left out of the income revenue because the plant is also run by the waste of the FFB Palm Oil which we supply to the company. If they dont share with us the income revenue, at least the company must feed the electricity supply to our respective homes as well to be part beneficiaries of the development. Photos of the Plants are shown below: EXESSIVE DEDUCTIONS: Also the company is placing excessive deductions on our small FFB Palm Oil Income Revenue to run its operation. All our toils are being watered down just to receive a lousy PGK 170, per pay day, even though the price of the Palm Oil is very high at the World Market in US Dollars. The lousy PGK 170 is equivalent to a lousy USD50.PRICING FORMULAI kindly ask the RSPO Board of Panel to help the Small Holder Growers to liaise with the company and review the pricing formula which they are using to pay the growers. REVIEW CONTRACT AGREEMENT: The CONTRACT AGREEMENT between the company and the Smallholder Growers were set in place by the Harrisons and Crossfield and the Australian Government in the early stages of our Oil Palm Development Project in 1967. Most of the policies and agreements set in place were for the beneficiary and gain of the manipulating company under the colonial mindset for the benefits of our ruling masters. The agreement placed the Smallholder Growers in an awkward position where we have no power to do or say in what the company was doing. We are being treated as slaves to the Company, the Government and the Oil Palm Industry. Even though our positive economic input are constant to the economic development of the country and the world as a whole, by supplying a steady tonnage of FFB Palm Oil to the company on a weekly basis. I sincerely urge the RSPO Board to assist us in reviewing the CONTRACT AGREEMENT on a roundtable with the Company and the Hoskins Oil Palm Growers Association (OPGA). The agreement must be satisfactory to both parties under RSPO Protocols and Humanitarian wellbeing.GENERAL HUMANITARIAN WELFARE AND SUSTAINABILITYThis is the forty eight (48) year of the Hoskins Oil Palm Project since 1967. The project have trained us to be good Palm Oil Growers adhering to the Protocols and Principles of the Palm Oil Industry through these prolonged period of time. In those early days when the RSPO Board was not set in place yet, we were taught the general practice and principles on palm oil through the DPI, about how to maintain the cleanliness of our oil palm blocks, homes, drinking water, to have in our custody the land title form, pay rental fees, maintaining boundary pegs, maintaining 100 metres buffer zone, how to apply fertilizers like ammonium phosphate and ammonium nitrite, process of harvesting and upkeeping, selective weeding, how to use chemicals and tools, policies against trespassing unnecessarily to other blocks without given consent from the owner, and maintaining a friendly and peaceful environment. In doing all those things we thought that in return we will receive a higher income to enhance and stabilize our living standards to a modernize standard. But all those hard labor work were all in vain. The price of the FFB Palm Oil is still on its lowest rates since we started in 1967, and even it went down to zero rates some years back. The cost of living are very high, with accumulating prices of goods and services, government GST taxes on every goods and services, high school fees demand, accumulating and extended families living in a single oil palm block. The Palm Oil FFB price and the pay we are receiving cannot sustain all these accumulating necessities of life. To tell the truth, right now we are surviving through subsistence gardening on little bits of reserve land we have. Otherwise weve all been dead. If we preach and talk about RSPO, the commodity we are dealing and working with must be sustainable enough to meet the standards and demands of every parties involved. We the primary producer of the commodity must be sustained and you the end user must be sustained and satisfied. We even cannot do savings to start up some other spinoff businesses. Throughout all these years we toil to nothing. Most of us have to search for optional means and ways for sustainable income to start up other profitable businesses. We live in run down homes with no proper water sanitation, no electricity, no proper health care, no life insurance cover, no proper working machineries. We even cant employ laborers to help us manage some of the work load due to financial incapabilities. All heavy jobs are done manually just by using our own strength. All our pioneering fathers have died young from all sorts of body conditions like; back problems, knee problems, eye problems, heart and kidney failures and many undiagnosed ailments because of high body strain levels with no stabilize diets. Even many of the growers were killed by falling FFBs and palm branches while in the process of harvesting. Others were killed by falling oil palm stumps which have been poisoned, while unknowingly working under them. There was no compensation for all those looses of lives. If we talk RSPO lets all come together on a round table and discuss all these underlying issues for the beneficiary and sustainability of us all under the RSPO concept.",2015-10-12: Complaints Panel - Case Closure 2015-09-07: Complainant's letter to NBPO. 2015-09-02: NBPO's response to the Complainant. 2015-09-02: NBPOL responded with their reply and also invited the complainant for bilateral negotiations. 2015-08-24: Complainant's response to RSPO.,https://rspo.my.site.com/Complaint/s/case/50090000028Es0xAAC/detail,{'case_number': None}

The email was a forwarded copy of an email to RSPO. He complained that there had been no response from SMRE unit of PT SIP, to a grievance that he submitted on 20/3/18 concerning the maintenance of the connecting street between Kampung Suka Bhakti and Kampung Batu Ampar which he believes is the responsibility of the company. PT SIP response: the street is in SMRE's area and was previously used as an access road by the Company. Currently the road is no longer used by SMRE which prefers to use an access road inside the estate. The road is frequently damaged by the many vehicles transporting sand from the village which has not taken part in repairing the road. In addition, many planted rubber trees along the road prevent the roads from drying quickly when they are wet leading to more damage. SMRE has appealed to the villagers to help trim the rubber trees, but they have not taken any action. Mr Hendi Apriyadi is aware that the street has often been repaired by SMRE and witnessed repair works on 23/3/18. Previous repair also took place in December 2017. These repair works were documented. PT SIP is committed to helping the local community and will repair the road concerned in accordance to a schedule which includes maintenance and repair of other village and public infrastructure. SMRE is involved in fixing and maintaining other roads and the heavy equipment needed for the repair works is in high demand in other areas and villages, including for the repair of public roads.",,

This activity was carried out as a follow-up on a grievance re PT SPS-2 activities on peatlands within its palm oil estate in Nagan Raya, Aceh. The grievance was raised by Foresthints on its 11 June 2018 and 3 August 2018 articles. During the field visit, the following facts were observed:1. The areas under investigation are located in Block OJ13 and Block OI11. The land area of the two blocks were developed before 2015, when SPS-2 made a commitment of No New Peatland Development. 2. Most of the planted palm trees in the above areas did not survive because of a number of reasons. Currently the unplanted areas are dominated by very tall ferns and bushes. 3. On-going activities in the areas including insertion plantings, maintenance of ditches and construction of a road present a threat to the existing peatlands and peat forests adjacent to the areas. GAR recommends SPS-2 implement the following policies and programmes:1. Stop all activities in the unplanted areas of the above blocks. 2. Conduct studies of peatland hydrology and other related issues to assess the impacts of agricultural activities in those blocks, including building ditches, road maintenance and insertion plantings. The outcome of those studies should be shared for feedback with the respective authorities at local and national levels. GAR supports SPS-2 policy to conserve the natural forests on peatlands within SPS-2 concession, and encourage full compliance with the government directives on AMDAL, water management and rehabilitation of the degraded peatlands. GAR appreciates the transparency demonstrated by SPS-2 in the field visit activity as this is a key element in achieving sustainable palm oil. 13/11/18: GAR and RAN met to discuss progress on SPS2. GAR informed RAN that due to the unsatisfactory progress on how SPS2 delivered conflict resolution process as to the deforestation caused by encroachment in its concession, GAR had deemed SPS2 to be non-compliant with GAR grievance handling process. This status of non-compliance will remain in place until PT SPS2 establishes a transparent, credible and independent conflict resolution process to resolve conflicts with local communities and commits to take the following actions: 1. Designate who within the company is responsible for overseeing the conflict resolution process and then compile a dossier of any existing Land Tenure Studies and assessments that have been conducted. This dossier will be used to identify which parts thereof a social baseline assessment, land tenure and use studies, Social and Environmental Impact Assessments need to be repeated. 2. Commission an independent assessment into the past implementation of relevant social requirements for the acquisition of the palm oil concession to identify whether any harm have been caused as a result of actions by the company that may require remedy. External consultants with the requisite social research skills and experience must conduct this assessment. 3. The company through an independent and competent mediator agency shares the findings and recommendations of the assessment with communities and starts discussions on possible next steps. These relate to obtaining initial consent and establishing mechanisms for subsequent interactions and assessments/re-assessments; discussion of what additional protections may need to be put into place in fulfillment of the social requirements for responsible palm oil production; and discussion of what form of remedy may be appropriate in cases where harms have been identified. The company staff who lead this engagement with communities, should do so with assistance for either party from external advisors and/or facilitators as requested by local communities. 4. Redo/do the Land Tenure and Use Study, or parts of it, if necessary, as well as the Social Background Study and bibliography. These studies need to be conducted by an independent third party, and reflect inputs and perspectives from all stakeholders, including local communities and governments from the local to national levels. 5. Quality assurances of all these studies and of the community engagement process should be carried out by an independent third party trusted by local communities with clear and time-bound follow up and actions to ensure that they have all been conducted effectively.",,

Thecorrect data is based on the measurement conductedby BPN RI (National Land Agency). In the HGU withthe correct measurement, thearea of 1,997. 5 Ha has notbeen developed and it currentlyremains as forests, community plantations, community settlements as well asgovernment offices/public facilities,etc. b) Re RAN allegations that in 2012, the Aceh National Land Agency demarcated a permanent boundary that was disputed by local communities who were excluded from the boundary delineationprocess. The boundaries negotiated between the National Land Agency and the company were different from those recognised and agreed by the former governor. Nafasindo clarified that asordered by the National Land Agency, the company submitted to thecourt the decree bythe Aceh Governor who ordered the demarcation withthe wrong measurement. The Indonesian National Land Agency (BPN RI), also ordered Nafasindo to revise its HGU. c) Re RAN allegation that around 100 farmers have been arrested and in some cases detained by police and imprisoned and later relocated.

This negotiated outcome did not fully restore the rights of local communities to their customary lands, but it was agreed as a way to move forward and secure some level of economic stability for local communities.

We understand that PT Tasma Puja had obtained all mandatory legal permits (ILOK in 2006; IUP in 2007 and with extension in 2013) before the alleged area was designated as a forest area by the Government of Indonesia (GoI) in 2014 and 2016. Critically, when the legal permits were issued, the land did not overlap with a designated forest area. To address the current overlap, PT Tasma Puja is applying for a forest release permit with the Ministry of the Environment and Forestry of Indonesia and with the provincial government of Riau. We will continue to monitor the company's effort and progress towards a resolution. As stated in the Tempo's letter, more than 3. 4 million hectares of palm oil plantations overlap with designated forest areas. The situation of PT Tasma Puja is not unique. GAR supports the GoI's implementation of the Omnibus Law and the One Map Policy to resolve this industry challenge. 21/10/21: Re the allegation that TP's Batang Cenaku mill has received FFB's harvested from inside Bukit Betabuh protected area and the conflict with some plasma smallholders, GAR has contacted TP for feedback.

PT Mamuang II. PT Lestari Tani Telada (LTT) III. PT Agro Nusa Abadi (ANA)","In October 2020, we received information from Procter & Gamble that WALHI Central Sulawesi submitted a complaint regarding land conflict at PT AAL’s subsidiaries; PT Mamuang, PT LTT and PT ANA. The allegations are as follows: PT Mamuang allegedly seized 50 ha of land belonging to local farmers. The company has criminalised farmers from Panca Mukti Village. One community member was wrongfully criminalised on three occasions, and imprisoned as a result. PT LTT has allegedly seized approximately 100 ha from farmers in the villages of Rio Mukti and Tawiora. The company also implements an outsourcing system, mismatches working hours and fails to follow a wage system in accordance with Indonesian labour law, whereby the price of palm oil fruits produced by the farmers are determined by the company alone. PT ANA has allegedly seized 5,000 ha of land belonging to farmers of Molino Village, Bungintimbe Village, Tompira Village and Bunta Village, and is operating without a land use permit (HGU). The company is alleged to have only location permits, thus being in violation of local laws concerning taxation and regional income. Wilmar immediately reached out to PT AAL to investigate the above allegations, where AAL has clarified accordingly. In November 2020, Wilmar also held a meeting with AAL for further discussion on the matter. PT Mamuang: PT AAL explained that since the 1990s, PT Mamuang has established and maintained a harmonious relationship with the surrounding community, especially because its existence has provided benefits to the community. Several media articles had also reported the positive relationship between PT Mamuang and the local community. News clippings available here and here. With regards to the allegation of criminalisation, here is the summary of events that led to the arrest and imprisonment: In 2006, a claim was made against PT Mamuang for ownership of 8 ha of land. Albeit PT Mamuang is the legal owner of the land, and have obtained legal operating permits, PT Mamuang’s management was still willing to engage with the complainant from 2006 to 2016 via negotiations and mediation processes with local authorities; their efforts however yielded little success. Between 2017 to 2019, the complainant and his son allegedly engaged in activities that resulted in his son being convicted for criminal charges. As a result of this, he was imprisoned. PT ALL reiterated that these were decisions made by legal authorities and the courts, with no influence from the company. PT LTT: The alleged land grab of 100 ha from local farmers has not been verified and PT AAL has sought for further information from the complainant in order to investigate the allegation. PT LTT clarified that it does not use outsourcing mechanisms or individual outsourcing for its operational activities. Determination of the price of Fresh Fruit Bunch (FBB) at PT LTT is carried out in accordance to the Regulation of the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia, Number 01 / Permentan / Kb.120 / 1/2018. PT LTT added that it has not received complaints from its farmers or farmer group institutions regarding pricing. PT ANA operates in accordance with all relevant legal permits. In the plantation development process, PT ANA always respects the rights of the community and ensures that each land tenure has gone through a process agreed upon with the community concerned. Procter & Gamble (P&G) officially lodged the case with Wilmar in March 2021. P&G has played a pivotal role in our repeated attempts to engage with WALHI to better understand the details of the allegations raised. We understand that P&G are also working closely with the international non-profit and land rights advocacy organisation, Landesa. The purpose of this collaboration is to further strengthen P&G's grievance mechanism and resolution approach related to land rights cases, with a specific focus on ongoing concerns raised by WALHI in relation to PT AAL.To accelerate progress, Landesa recommended an independent field verification to establish the facts on the ground. In March 2022 P&G commissioned and funded EcoNusantara (ENS), an independent advisory and consultancy expert to conduct field verification of the grievances submitted. The selection of ENS was made in consultation with and alignment of WALHI with local communities, PT AAL and Wilmar. ENS conducted the verification using an “open investigation” approach where every relevant party was informed in advance about the purpose of these activities. In addition to reviewing documents, in-depth interviews were conducted with key stakeholders, such as, WALHI National Executive and Sulawesi Central Regional Office, TUK Indonesia, PT AAL, the Sulawesi Plantation Department and Land Agency, Donggala District of Central Sulawesi Plantation Department and Land Agency and North Morowali District of Central Sulawesi Plantation Department. Direct face to face discussions were also held with community representative at six villages, including Panca Mukti, Tawiora, Bunta, Bungintimbe, Tompira, and Molino villages. All discussions were held in appropriate relevant local languages. ENS confirmed that all the stakeholders demonstrated goodwill, acted collaboratively during the interviews, and shared key information transparently in a way that is vital for the assessment and ultimate grievance resolution. ENS has transparently shared their findings in unilateral meetings with P&G, WALHI (held in Bahasa Indonesia), Wilmar and PT AAL. The final report was shared with Wilmar in September 2022. For more information on the outcome of the verification process commissioned by P&G, please refer to the executive summary report on the verification process prepared by P&G. PT AAL on the other hand has engaged with the Conflict Resolution Unit (CRU) to evaluate their current human rights related practices. Incubated through the Indonesia Business Council for Sustainable Development (IBCSD) in 2015, CRU is a conflict resolution service agency that provides independent support for resolving conflicts in the management of agrarian and natural resources.During the grievance investigation and verification process, we have closely engaged with all related parties, including PT AAL, P&G and ENS, where our last meeting was on 22 September 2022. PT AAL is committed to work towards the resolution of the case and more information related to their action plan will be provided in due course.On 31 March 2023, PT AAL released their public statement on the appointment of ENS to carry out comprehensive independent verification on the issues raised. The terms of reference (TOR) was finalised jointly with key stakeholders and supported by PT AAL’s sustainability consultant Robertsbridge Group. During the course of investigation, ENS will also open a complaint channel to capture issues raised by affected parties. On 12 May 2023, PT AAL published their progress update; where ENS will carry out the field assessment on the third week of May 2023 for initial set of interviews with community members, WALHI as the communities' advocate, and AAL related staff. On broader engagement level, ENS will be engaging with WALHI at local and national level, while Robertsbridge will be engaging with Friends of the Earth (US). ENS began the field verification process in late May 2023. A kick off meeting between ENS and WALHI was scheduled; unfortunately, WALHI did not participate at the last minute. Nonetheless, ENS commenced the field visits to affected communities of PT LTT, PT ANA, and PT Mamuang and the needs assessments in Toviora village, as planned. By early June 2023, ENS had completed the field visits and the initial interviews with local government officials and community representatives, with the aim to identify locations of disputed land claims. ENS conducted second phase of on-the-ground interviews starting from late June 2023 to verify findings from the initial interviews and to conduct further interviews with community members. The needs assessment with targeted communities at PT LTT was carried out with support from Tadulako University. ENS completed the field verification process by mid-August 2023 and commenced on the process of data analysis thereafter. In mid-September 2023, ENS highlighted that a government mediation process is taking place in two villages in the PT ANA area. ENS will monitor the outcome of the mediation process to assess the implications for its reporting. PT AAL, together with ENS, released the verification report on 27 November 2023. The report has been shared to the stakeholders and PT AAL has released their response to stakeholders who have raised queries about the report. On 2 January 2024, PT AAL published its response on the alleged intimidation and coercive action by PT AAL security staff against community members in Rio Mukti Village, which was reported by WALHI and FoE on 8 December 2023. PT AAL stated that it will carry out an internal fact-finding to gather all information related to the alleged coercion against two community members on signing a letter regarding land conflicts in PT. LTT. The findings of the internal investigation was published in the statement released on 9 February 2024. PT AAL clarified that the visit to the village by its CSR team was carried out at the invitation of the village head to discuss individual support measures for community members and to dispel rumours from unknown sources of criminalization, and that the visit was misconstrued as an act of intimidation. In the same statement released on 9 February 2024, PT AAL announced that it has re-appointed ENS to assist in developing an action plan to implement the recommendations of ENS’s independent verification of allegations raised by FoE in 2022. PT AAL will publish the finalized action plan and keep stakeholders updated with a monthly progress report. In June 2024, PT AAL published the final action plan, followed by the First Progress Report on Action Plan Implementation in September 2024 and second progress report on action plan implementation in November 2024.

We were informed by Bunga Group that they acquired Value Greenworld in late 2016, where the purchase agreement categorised the land as ‘shrubs’ and suitable for immediate planting. Due to this, Bunga Group proceeded with land clearing without conducting any HCV-HCS assessments. An immediate moratorium was imposed by Bunga Group on the Value Greenworld concession and all other plantations under Bunga Group in December 2020 when the non-compliance to NDPE was brought to Bunga Group’s attention prior to our engagement with them. Since then, Bunga Group has released their Sustainable Palm Oil Policy in January 2021. Based on the concession maps shared by Bunga Group with Wilmar, we have confirmed that the deforestation has indeed happened inside their concession area. As there was no HCS/HCV assessment conducted prior to land clearing, we considered this act of land clearing at Value Greenworld as non-compliant to our NDPE policy. Wilmar’s last purchase from this supplier was in March 2021 As of July 2021, Bunga Group has met all the requirements stipulated in our re-entry criteria. This includes their commitment to the development of a Recovery Plan for Non-Compliant Land Clearing to the NDPE policy at group level, for activity that has taken place from January 2016 onwards. Based on the detailed review of documentation, reports and a letter of commitment from Bunga Group, the Wilmar Suspension Committee has given due consideration of this progress and lifted the suspension of Bunga Group in July 2021.",https://www.mightyearth.org/wp-content/uploads/RR-Report-32_f_20210115.pdf,

However, several Wilmar’s suppliers are sourcing directly from YPPH. Prior to publication of the Mighty Earth 30 Rapid Response Report on 6 August 2020, our suppliers had already initiated engagement with YPPH since June 2020 when the alleged deforestation in YPPH was brought to their attention. YPPH clarified that they have received approval from the local authorities and have adhered to the state regulations before developing the area. EIA has also been conducted prior to land development and received approval from Department of Environment. YP Plantation has committed to adopt NDPE and imposed a moratorium on land clearing with effective from 17th August 2020.

However, our supplier, IJM Plantations sources directly from the above companies. Aspirasi Kristal (M) Sdn Bhd Prior to the publication of the Chain Reaction Report on 10 July 2020 on the allegation of IJM’s sourcing of non-compliant palm products from Aspirasi Kristal (AK), IJM Plantations has already initiated engagement with AK since 24 June 2020 when the alleged deforestation were brought to their attention. A physical meeting was conducted between IJM Plantations and AK on 6 July 2020, where IJM Plantations has followed up with an official letter requesting AK to cease all land clearing. AK responded officially on 20 July 2020 to IJM Plantations agreeing to cease all land clearing activities until investigation is completed. Another stakeholder, The Mighty Earth had also released a report on this above case in August 2020. In September 2020, Mighty Earth alerted Wilmar that suspected land clearing activities in AK’s concession were detected. Wilmar has immediately engaged with IJM Plantations seeking clarification on the matter. AK claimed that the areas were cleared in 2019 and the recent activities involved construction of terraces and road development on the cleared areas. AK reiterated no new clearing activities were conducted since 30 July 2020. IJM Plantations decided to suspend the FFB supply from AK while investigation is ongoing. Satria Eramaju No active land clearing was detected at Satria Eramaju (SE). SE has also acknowledged NDPE commitment and assured that relevant assessments will be conducted prior to any land clearing.

349,Wilmar International,,Closed,7/6/2020,,,,,Liberty Shared,Sime Darby Plantation Berhad,,,,Alleged labour rights violation in Sime Darby Plantation Berhad’s operation,"On 6 July 2020, Liberty Shared (LS) published a summary of their petition to the United States Customs and Border Protection (US CBP) to “exclude palm oil and palm oil products produced wholly or in part by forced labour and child labour by Sime Darby Plantation Berhad (SDP) owned and affiliated companies.” The petition was submitted to the US CBP on 20 April 2020. SDP clarified that the petition was submitted to US CBP without solicitation of feedback from the organization, and that it had access only to the petition summary, which does not contain details of issues raised by LS. SDP has since engaged with Duncan Jepson, the author of the petition, to better understand and expeditiously resolve the concerns raised. SDP has published the following statements in response to LS based on the limited information that was available to it. The statements reiterate SDP’s commitment to uphold human rights and good labour practices, as well as implement appropriate corrective actions to eradicate any human rights violations. First statement dated 8 July 2020 Second statement dated 10 July 2020 Third statement dated 7 August 2020 On 10 November 2020, SDP announced the appointment of Independent Experts to further strengthen its human rights commitments and compliance. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) was appointed on 19 October 2020 to support SDP in establishing effective platforms and channels of communication to address concerns in its Malaysian operations. The other appointment is of an independent international specialist on migrant worker rights to assist SDP in improving its migrant worker recruitment processes (further details below). On 18 November 2020, The Associated Press (AP) published an article titled “Rape, abuses in palm oil fields linked to top beauty brands”, which reported abuse of women in SDP’s plantations. SDP released a public statement in response to the article, reiterating zero tolerance for any forms of sexual or human rights violations, exploitation or any other criminal offenses. SDP stated that it had commenced further internal investigations over the allegation and is committed to take all necessary actions. On 3 December 2020, SDP issued a second statement, identifying the specific case highlighted by AP. SDP explained that the complainant had withdrawn her complaint in April 2019, two months after it was first brought to light. In revisiting the matter, the complainant indicated that she had no intention of reopening the case and denied that offensive statements had been made to her in the first place. SDP thus had no basis to pursue further investigations and have closed the case again. Despite SDP’s efforts, on 30 December 2020, US CBP issued a Withhold Release Order (WRO) that all U.S. ports of entry will detain palm oil and products containing palm oil produced by SDP and its subsidiaries, joint ventures, and affiliated entities in Malaysia. The issuance of the WRO was based on information that reasonably indicated the presence of all 11 of the International Labour Organization’s forced labour indicators in SDP’s production process. SDP issued a statement in response to the WRO on 31 December 2020, reiterating its pledge to combat forced labour. The statement also indicated that CBP had still not provided sufficient information to allow SDP to meaningfully address the allegations that triggered the issuance of the WRO. RSPO also issued a statement on the WRO, urging USCBP to share any information that will allow for RSPO to properly investigate this matter and report transparently on the findings. In continuing its efforts to resolve the issue, SDP has announced the establishment of its Experts Stakeholder Human Rights Assessment Commission (the Commission) on 1 March 2021. SDP has appointed Impactt Ltd, an ethical trade consultancy and expert in the detection and remediation of labour issues in supply chains, to the Commission, to conduct an evaluation of SDP’s labour practices across its Malaysian operations. The Commission will also consist of a Stakeholder Consultation Panel (the Stakeholder Panel), who will provide additional views on Impactt’s assessment methodology and review forced labour indicators in SDP’s operations as well as proposed remediation plans. Members of the Stakeholder Panel include Shift, the leading centre of expertise on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and Mr. Andy Hall, a migrant worker rights specialist. SDP expects the independent assessments by Impactt to be completed by May 2021, following which disclosure will be made by to SDP’s key stakeholders and the public, on the Commission’s findings. On 4 June 2021, SDP appointed Professor Justine Nolan, a human rights expert, to its Commission and reported that it was expecting Impactt’s evaluation of its labour practices in Malaysia to be completed in June 2021. On 15 July 2021, SDP dissolved the Commission to provide for more time for the evaluation exercise to be carried out. SDP cited delays due to COVID-19 travel restrictions and that oversight of the evaluation will be undertaken by its Board’s Sustainability Committee. On 28 January 2022, the US CBP determined that certain SDP palm oil products are produced using convict, forced or indentured labour. SDP in its statement reiterated its efforts to undertake a full-scale, independent assessment across its Malaysian operations and reaffirmed that it would fully cooperate with the US CBP in demonstrating full compliance with US import regulations. On 15 February, SDP announced improvements to its governance structures, policies and procedures. This includes the following: Reimbursement of recruitment fees: Following calculations by an independent third party, SDP’s Board approved a provision of Rm82.02 million in reimbursements to its current and past foreign workers. Workers will receive their monies on 17 February 2022 and have access to various channels of communication to raise concerns. SDP has also set up a Sinking Fund Governance Committee (SFGC) to oversee the reimbursement process and is engaging law firms in each country of origin to management the disbursement of funds. Ethical recruitment: SDP launched its Responsible Recruitment Procedure (RRP) in August 2021, which emphasises the appointment of suitable recruitment agents in ensuring non-exploitation of workers. SDP is committing to conducting regular due diligence on appointed recruitment agents and monitor their performance to ensure compliance to SDP’s recruitment standards. Agents who are in breach will have their contracts terminated. Worker welfare: SDP has rolled out various communication platforms to enable workers to raise concerns and grievances. Existing grievance and whistleblowing changes have also been improved, following the establishment of a centralised Grievance unit at Headquarters. All workers have also been provided with personal lockers to store their passports. Structural changes: SDP’s Board has approved an ESG scorecard across its Upstream Malaysia operations and established a new Social Welfare & Services (SWS) department. The various initiatives are overseen by SDP’s Board Sustainability Committee, and supported by a two-tier management team which meets regularly. On 3 February 2023, the US CBP has modified its forced labor findings against SDP effective immediately, the US CBP will now permit the importation of palm oil from SDP into the United States and has recognized the comprehensive process undertaken by SDP in the last two years to review, revise and upgrade its protocols for recruiting, managing and working with its workers. SDP has also released a press statement to further brief on actions taken.",https://www.wilmar-international.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/sustainability/grievance/grievance-case-report/summary-of-the-petition-submitted-to-cbp-on-20th-april-2020.pdf?sfvrsn=995e7096_2,
350,Wilmar International,,Closed,6/24/2020,,,,,Rainforest Action Network (RAN),PT Perkebunan Nusantara 1 (PTPN 1) Tualang Sawit,,,,"Alleged deforestation by PT Perkebunan Nusantara 1 (PTPN 1) Tualang Sawit, a subsidiary of PTPN 1","Wilmar has initiated investigation on the case of when the allegation was brought to our attention in 2019 and 2018. During the course of investigation, PTPN 1 has provided their signed commitment to the NDPE policy as well as shared their boundary map and planting map profile with us for the investigation and ongoing monitoring of the case. Our last physical meeting with PTPN 1 was in November 2019 in Medan. PTPN 1 Tualang Sawit plantation is located in Blang Tualang village, Aceh Timur district, Aceh. PTPN 1 started to develop the area in 1990 and completed most of their land clearing in 1995. Based on the planting map profile shared by PTPN 1, we understand that planting activities started in 1991 and abruptly ceased in 1999 due to security concerns over the insurgency in Aceh. When the Military Operations Area (Daerah Operasi Militer) was enforced, PTPN 1 was forced to abandon their management of these planted areas due to the dire social and security issues during the insurgency. It was only when the conditions improved in 2014 that PTPN 1 started slowly to resume their maintenance of the area and replanted the unproductive and overgrown oil palm area in areas that had already been planted in 1990 - 1999. Our internal Land Use Change Analysis (LUCA) has verified the land clearing and planting profile, as well as confirmed that all re-planting activities happened inside the area that was previously cleared and planted in 1990 – 1999 by PTPN 1. For the case of PTPN 1, we recognize their current activities within the areas that was previously developed by them between 1990 – 1999 as replanting activities. The government’s enforcement of the Military Operations Areas caused an unavoidable abandonment due to external factors by PTPN 1 until 2014. This meant that there was no possible way for PTPN 1 to maintain the planted areas until they were able to re-enter the plantations in 2014. PTPN1 is committed to conduct HCV-HCS assessment and imposed a moratorium on further activities on the ground in the meantime. Wilmar will continue to monitor PTPN1’s activities and guide them towards the compliance to the NDPE policy. Our last meeting with PTPN1 was on 7 August 2020. It is crucial to note that we have been in engagement with PTPN1 since 2015 when they first participated in our Aggregator Refinery Transformation (ART) programme. Our team, together with TFT (now known as Earthworm Foundation) conducted a field assessment to PTPN 1 Pulau Tiga in May 2015. Several meetings and engagements took place thereafter to guide them towards the improvement of their practices to be aligned with our NDPE policy. PTPN1 had also actively participated in our Supplier Reporting Tool (SRT) programme when we first launched the programme to our Indonesia supplier base in 2018. Meanwhile, we continue to engage and closely monitor PTPN1 to ensure that they uphold their moratorium on further activities on the ground while working on their options for the HCV–HCS assessment.","https://www.ran.org/leuser-watch/deforestation-for-palm-oil-climbs/#:~:text=As%20the%20impact%20of%20the,Aceh%20Timur%20operated%20by%20PT",

PT MPHS clarified that both High Conservation Value (HCV) and High Carbon Stock (HCS) assessments, which were finalised in early 2019, were conducted by ALS registered and recognised assessors. Subsequently, PT MPHS has been using the HCV/HCS map to guide their land development activities. Desktop monitoring by Wilmar identified 26 small sporadic patches of land clearing, totalling between 20 to 30 hectares, may have occurred inside HCV/HCS areas. Field verification by PT MPHS to investigate the allegations, initially scheduled for March 2020, was postponed to June 2020 following movement restrictions imposed by the authorities due to the COVID-19 situation. Further investigation revealed that the land clearance was a result of pressure from the community to develop areas for plasma smallholders programme. Several field assessments have been conducted thereafter to determine the details or the affected areas and location. The full field details were finally completed in September 2020. PT MPHS has agreed to rehabilitate the pockets of land clearing that were identified in the HCV/HCS assessment reports. Working together with Balai Pengawas Daerah Aliran Sungai (BPDAS, Indonesian Watershed Monitoring Agency) since November 2020, PT MPHS also committed to plant 30,000 trees as part of their rehabilitation plan. Engagement with the communities on alternative plasma plans are ongoing, as the communities want the area to be cleared for plasma. PT MPHS also committed to appoint a registered and recognised assessor to integrate the individual HCV and HCS assessment reports following the HCV-HCS Integrated Manual, and submit the integrated report to be peer reviewed by HCVRN while observing a strict moratorium on further land clearance, which has been put place from September 2020. There were some delays in the finalisation of integrated reports due to worsening of COVID-19 pandemic, where it was finally been submitted to the HCVRN on 11 July 2021. In the meantime, they have also prepared management plans for HCV/HCS areas, therefore protecting these areas while preventing similar incidences from reoccurring.

352,Wilmar International,,Closed,2/18/2020,,,,,Rainforest Action Network (RAN),Mopoli Raya,,,,Alleged involvement in labour right issues by PT Mopoli Raya,"Engagement was immediately initiated with PT Mopoli Raya (MR) when the allegation of non-payment of worker’s wages at PT MR and PT Alue Kuyun was brought to Wilmar's attention. The withholding of workers’ wages led to a strike on 30 January 2020, where the Bupati (local regent) of West Aceh had also publicly urged PT MR to resolve the issues. PT MR clarified that due to their financial situation, they were unable to process all the wage payments. They reiterated that they are committed to continue engagement with their workers and the union, to address the issue amicably. The Wilmar team conducted a field visit from 9 – 13 March 2020 to further investigate the case, in order to understand the root cause of the incident and assist PT MR to develop an action plan to address the issues. During the field visit, our team met with PT MR’s management team, visited Alue Kuyun palm oil mill, PT MR's plantations, and interviewed several concerned parties, including workers from the mill/plantation and union representatives from Serikat Pekerja Aneka Industri - Federasi Serikat Pekerja Metal Indonesia (SPAI-FSPMI). Due to a financial crisis, PT MR has already ceased most of its non-essential activities including manuring and spraying for several years. Many workers had left PT MR to work for other companies, and those who remained with the company are mainly community members living near the company premises. During our interviews with workers, we were informed that in general, their working relationship with the company has been conducive. The company had also paid them bonuses up to two months in the past, when the company was making profit. In addition, the company has adopted several policies in protecting worker’s rights and freedom of association. The workers are able to freely join the union, and approximately 50% of the workers there are unionised. However, due to continued financial constraints, PT MR was not been able to pay November 2019 and December 2019 wages in full to the workers. Only 50% of the wages were paid. On 11 January 2020, the unions and workers demanded for PT MR to settle all outstanding wages by 15 January 2020, which PT MR was unable to do. This hence triggered the strike on 30 January 2020, with over 600 workers joining the strike. On 17 February 2020, a multi-stakeholder meeting was held in West Aceh Bupati’s office, which was attended by representatives from the Regional Secretary, 0105 Military District Comander, West Aceh Police Department, West Aceh Transmigration and Manpower Agency, West Aceh Regency Plantation and Livestock Department, Union representative FSPMI of PT MR, and PT MR’s management team. A wage payment schedule was successfully developed and agreed upon by all parties during the meeting. During our visit, we confirmed that PT MR has followed the payment schedule and in fact has advanced the February 2020 payment earlier than the agreed schedule. In 2021 however, Wilmar was informed that due to the continued financial situation of PT MR, the company had been declared bankrupt. Workers' wages were settled by PT MR up to March 2021. Wilmar has therefore ceased sourcing from PT MR since April 2021.",https://aceh.antaranews.com/berita/118825/bupati-aceh-barat-pt-mopoli-raya-harus-bayar-uang-gaji-karyawan,
353,Wilmar International,,In Progress,12/19/2023,,,,,Aliansi Gerakan Reforma Agraria (AGRA),Hardaya Inti Plantation,,,,,"We initiated a series of engagement with PT Hardaya Inti Plantation (PT HIP) since June 2023 to seek clarification on allegations related to plasma obligations, which was detected through our regular media monitoring (article here). PT HIP clarified that it has exceeded the 20% plasma obligation for the recipients listed in the Letter of Prospective Farmers for Land Candidates (Calon Petani Calon Lahan) and indicated that grievances were raised by individuals who are not plasma recipients. In December 2023, Aliansi Gerakan Reforma Agraria (AGRA) submitted a petition to Wilmar on similar allegations, related to PT HIP’s plasma scheme agreement with its plasma cooperatives in the Buol district. The petition also outlined concerns regarding transparency in profit-sharing calculation, the cost of plasma development, bank loan repayments and the management of the plasma scheme cooperatives. AGRA has requested that Wilmar refrain from publishing the case on its tracker while the investigation is ongoing. As part of our ongoing engagement with PT HIP, PT HIP has clarified that they were engaging with the cooperative management and the relevant local government agencies to provide clarification of the case and working towards the resolution of issues raised. On 6 January 2024, AGRA shared with Wilmar a letter addressed to PT HIP, from the Forum Petani Plasma Buol (FPPB) – grassroots organization representing the individuals claiming ownership of plasma area. The letter notified that road blockades will be set up on 8 January 2024 to stop all oil palm harvesting activities in plasma areas managed by affected cooperatives. Since then, neither the cooperative management nor PT HIP conducted any harvesting activities at the plasma plantation areas. On 25 January 2024, a meeting was held between Wilmar and AGRA to discuss the case in greater detail. In February 2024, the Commission for the Supervision of Business Competition (Komisi Pengawas Persaingan Usaha,KPPU) began the trial related to alleged violations of plasma scheme agreement which was submitted on behalf Koperasi Plasma Amanah in August 2022. On 9 July 2024, KPPU issued an initial decision directing PT HIP to pay a fine and implement several corrective actions related to the cooperative management of Koperasi Amanah. On 26 July 2024, a follow up meeting was held between Wilmar, AGRA, FPPB, and Sawit Watch to discuss the KPPU’s initial decision. On 31 July 2024, Wilmar met with PT HIP to seek clarification on the implementation of the KPPU decision and their engagement with the local community and stakeholders. PT HIP clarified that the KPPU decision is still in the early stages of the litigation process. They shared with us their plans for the appeal process and reiterated their commitment to complying with the final KPPU decision. PT HIP’s case appeal is publicly available here. In the spirit of transparency, Wilmar encouraged AGRA to reconsider their position on reporting the case in the Wilmar Grievance Listing in July 2024. Upon receiving their consent, the case was officially recorded in the Wilmar Grievance Listing. An appeal was filed by PT HIP with the High Court in July 2024 but was subsequently rejected. PT HIP has since submitted a further appeal to the Supreme Court on in November 2024. Wilmar continues to monitor the outcome of the legal proceedings and remains engaged with PT HIP and all other relevant stakeholders in working towards a resolution of the case.",,
354,Wilmar International,,Closed,9/19/2022,,,,,Rainforest Action Network (RAN),Runding Putra Persada,,,,,"Non-compliant palm products from Mr. Mahmudin, a smallholder operating in the Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve (RSWR) area allegedly entered Wilmar’s supply chain through its supplier, PT Runding Putra Persada (PT RPP) via a Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) dealer CV Buana Indah (CV BI).Wilmar does not source from CV BI. However, our supplier, PT RPP was allegedly sourcing from CV BI. Wilmar immediately initiated engagement with PT RPP when allegations of their non-compliant sourcing within RSWR was brought to our attention in September 2022. According to the report, Mr. Mahmudin was operating illegally within RSWR and was supplying to PT RPP via CV BI. On 31 October 2022, RAN published additional information on the case titled “Major Indonesian Palm Oil Suppliers Falsely Deny Sourcing Illegal Palm Oil” on the issue linked to Mr. Mahmudin’s farm that allegedly extends beyond the boundary of the RSWR. A series of meeting and engagement with PT RPP was carried out thereafter. A field verification from 7 to 15 November 2022 has been carried out to verify the allegation and to support the development of an action plan to address the issues identified. The field visit concluded that Mr Mahmudin has a certificate of ownership (SHM) covering an area of 29 hectares. However, he has further claimed ownership of additional 4 hectares within RSWR which has not yet been allocated SHM. In addition, Mr Mahmudin’s FFB collection point also lacks adequate traceability mechanism to map the FFB that are sourced from the local community farms around Mr Mahmudin's farm. It has been confirmed that CV BI is indeed PT RPP’s supplier, which they have started sourcing since April 2022. The outcome of the investigation and the action plan were discussed with RAN on 1 December 2022. The final field verification report has also been shared with RAN on 21 December 2022. In March 2023, a verification field visit was undertaken to assess the progress of the action plan. It was found that PT RPP has made improvements to the traceability system but the supply chain data collection at CV BI and the handover of 4 hectares of Mr. Mahmudin's land inside RSWR were progressing slower than expected. In order to accelerate progress to meet the action plan targets by June 2023, further assistance will be extended to PT RPP on its traceability programme and our team will engage with Mr. Mahmudin and CV BI in May 2023. The full report is available here. In May 2023, a follow up field visit was carried out. PT RPP has achieved 94% Traceability to Plantation (TtP) and its staff have been trained on the traceability system. After a delayed start on the traceability mapping process due to unforeseen circumstances, Koltiva began the traceability work on CV BI’s and Mr Mahmudin’s suppliers in March and May 2023 respectively. Thus, Koltiva has revised timeline for 100% TtP to September 2023. During this visit, the field team also discussed with Mr. Mahmudin on the progress of the land release of the 4 hectares. In early June 2023, our team met with Balai Konservasi & Sumber Daya Alam, BKSDA (Agency of Conservation and Natural Resources) as the authority for management and monitoring of RSWR, and Balai Pemantapan Kawasan Hutan, BPKH (Agency of Forest Area Consolidation Center) as the authority for boundary marking of RSWR, with the aim to understand the management and monitoring of RSWR, and process of releasing land occupied by community within the RSWR. In June 2023, another follow up field visit was carried out. Mr. Mahmudin was not available to meet with field team during this field visit. The field team was later informed that Mr. Mahmudin was not willing to sign the commitment letter to release the 4 hectares. Consequently, PT RPP and CV BI have issued a statement on 13 July 2023 to exclude Mr. Mahmudin from their supply chain. With this latest development, Wilmar has also included Mr. Mahmudin on its list of “high risk” FFB supplier, where all Wilmar direct suppliers operating within the 50km radius of the Leuser Ecosystem will be notified on the development of this case. Mr. Mahmudin’s FFB will only be allowed to enter their supply chain when the case is resolved to our satisfaction. A verification visit was carried out in October 2023 to assess PT RPP and CV BI’s progress in achieving 100% traceability. The documents and traceability data provided by PT RPP and CV BI, developed with support from Koltiva, showed that the 100% TtP has been achieved. The traceability data also indicated that neither PT RPP nor CV BI has sourced FFB from Mr. Mahmudin since 13 July 2023, when both PT RPP and CV BI issued a statement to exclude Mr. Mahmudin from their supply chain. In addition, PT. RPP has also carried out an evaluation of all CV BI suppliers to ensure that all FFB supply is sourced from outside of the RSWR. Considering that PT. RPP has completed the required activities as per the agreed action plan, the case on PT. RPP can be considered resolved. The summary of the outcome of the investigation and key milestone are available in this Joint Closing Statement. At the landscape level at Leuser, we are committed to ongoing engagement with direct and broader stakeholders in the Leuser landscape, including local communities, smallholders, and relevant government agencies, including some companies listed in RAN’s reports. This includes organizing workshops for smallholder capacity building and raising awareness about forest protection, particularly in the Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve (RSWR). Our latest workshop, held on 15 May 2024, included local government institutions, CSOs, RAN, companies operating in the region, smallholders, and communities. The workshop focused on government regulations and management in the Southern Aceh landscape, our sourcing policy, traceability, and grievance handling mechanisms. The workshop was also featured in local media here and here. In October 2024, a field visit was conducted as part of the ongoing monitoring of PT RPP’s TtP implementation. The assessment confirmed that PT RPP remains committed to their written assurance dated 12 July 2023, which states they will not source FFB from Mr. Mahmudin’s plantation. Additionally, the verification team observed progress in enhancing traceability documentation among FFB suppliers, including new farmers working with PT RPP’s dealers. Although many of these dealers operate some distance from the RSWR, they have reaffirmed their commitment not to source FFB from these areas. In November 2024, RAN released a new report titled “Orangutan Capital’ Under Siege” regarding cases linked to deforestation and the sourcing of non-compliant palm oil in the Leuser region. While none of Wilmar’s direct suppliers are implicated in the report, we remain committed to continuing our engagement with both direct and broader stakeholders in the Leuser landscape to address the concerns of deforestation at the landscape level.",https://www.ran.org/leuser-watch/carbon-bomb-scandals-big-brands-driving-climate-disaster-for-palm-oil/,

Our supplier, Jernih Kemboja, however is implicated due to their association with AA Sawit. Wilmar immediately initiated engagement with Jernih Kemboja when allegations of deforestation at PTD 4882, 4085, 4963, 4118, 4177 and 4121 by AA Sawit was brought to our attention in July 2022. A field investigation was carried in August 2022 to verify the allegations. Our field investigation as well as LUCA analysis on their concession maps thereafter has confirmed that there is non-compliance to the No Deforestation commitment to the NDPE Policy. Wilmar’s last purchase from this supplier was in September 2022. As of October 2023, Jernih Kemboja has met all the requirements stipulated in our re-entry criteria. This includes their commitment to the development of a Recovery Plan for Non-Compliant Land Clearing to the NDPE policy at group level, for activity that has taken place from January 2016 onwards.

357,Wilmar International,,Closed,10/7/2021,,,,,Global Witness,"Gilford Ltd, a subsidiary of Rimbunan Hijau (PNG) Group",,,,,"In July 2021, a letter was sent to Wilmar’s customers from the NGO Global Witness (GW), alleging environmental and social non-compliance incidents by Gilford Limited (GL). A summary of the allegations in the letter were as follows: Environmental degradation and deforestation activities; Violence and harassment against community members, through local police; Lack of Free, Prior, Informed Consent (FPIC) prior to development of land; Decent accommodation and facility for employees living in company housing; and Workers’ health and safety. GL is not a direct supplier to Wilmar; however, they were allegedly linked to our supplier, Rimbunan Hijau (RH), at the group level. Wilmar immediately reached out to RH for clarification on the issues raised by GW and has been actively engaging with the company since. RH has rebutted the allegations and provided us with all relevant documentation, which includes; A field visit report by an independent consultant; Evidence of engagements between GL and GW since 2017; Landowner consent forms to ascertain FPIC and identify cultural sites requiring protection; Voluntarily written statements by a landowner, the contents of which were further corroborated by a statement given by a local ward councillor; Correspondence between GL and the Royal Papua New Guinea (PNG) Constabulary; Board meeting minutes by landowner companies; and A mediated agreement between GL and a landowner company issued by the PNG National Court. The extensive supporting documents provided by RH has generally clarified the issues raised in GW’s letter, except on the matter of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) provision to its workers; which still warrants further investigation and continued engagement with RH to resolve the issue.On the allegation of lack of FPIC, GL has reaffirmed that landowners’ consent (i.e. FPIC) is a legally stipulated requirement in PNG to obtain a Special Agricultural Business Lease (SABL), to which they fully adhere. Furthermore, a voluntary statement from one of the landowners, which was shared with us, has also indicates that FPIC was in order, prior to land development. Concerning the allegation of violence and harassment, GL informed us that any reported police presence was sanctioned by the Royal PNG Constabulary and that no malpractice was found following investigations by high-level authorities, including the Ombudsman Commission. Regarding the allegation of deforestation and environmental issues, GL has clarified that their operational planning and execution are compliant with all legal requirements. In fact, this compliance has been monitored by the PNG Forest Authority Project Supervisor on-site, to ensure protection of all culturally important sites and other specific protected areas such as buffer zones along rivers and streams, village reserves, conservation zones for fauna and flora, as well as sites of historical importance such as old village sites and caves. Since project commencement, GL has not received any specific complaints from any affected landowners, ward councillors, village court officials, or any government officials on environmental matters. In addition, it is also important to note that Wilmar has engaged with GL since 2018 on their compliance to NDPE, where GL has committed to carrying out HCV-HCS assessments prior to any new land clearing. A moratorium on new land clearing has been imposed since 2018. For more information related to this case, please refer to Wilmar’s Grievance List, specifically the case registered in 2018 under Gilford Ltd.On the matter of PPE provision, Wilmar has worked closely with GL to improve their practices in alignment with our NDPE Policy. This includes improvements to their PPE Policy, as well as the socialisation of the policy to all levels of management and operations, with effective on-the-ground implementation. On 7 October 2021, GW released a public report titled ’The True Price of Palm Oil’. The allegations on GL in this report are largely similar to those made in the letter sent to Wilmar’s customers in July 2021. However, the report contains additional information related to GL’s health and safety practices, where Wilmar has conducted further investigation and provided support to GL in addressing the identified gapsby enhancing their policies, staff training as well as improving the reporting and monitoring of health and safety incidents, among other measures. From 19 to 28 September 2024, Wilmar conducted a field assessment at GL with the support from an external international consultancy and management organisation with extensive experience in PNG. The field team comprised five members: Wilmar’s Assistant General Manager for Sustainability, Health and Safety Lead for Wilmar's Malaysia operations, Supplier Engagement & Compliance Lead for Wilmar Indonesia, and two representatives from the consultancy firm, including the Director and a local consultant based in PNG. The objective of this field visit was to assess GL’s progress in closing identified gaps and verify certain allegations raised in the GW report. The primary areas of focus were Health and Safety, Grievance Procedures, FPIC, community engagement, worker welfare, and the verification of deforestation claims. Additionally, prior to our field assessment, GL had engaged Certification Bodies to evaluate their compliance with the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) Certification standard, which serves as a reference for the implementation of sustainability practices, covering various criteria related to the aforementioned areas. The outcome of our field assessment confirmed that GL has made significant progress in addressing the gaps, particularly in enhancing their Health and Safety measures, a key area for improvement identified previously. The assessment also confirmed that GL has not engaged in deforestation since September 2018, following their commitment to a moratorium on land clearing. Furthermore, GL has appointed a Head of Sustainability to oversee the Sustainability Department and ensure continued implementation of its policies and commitments. Meanwhile, Wilmar remains actively engaged in supporting and working with GL to further strengthen their sustainability practices.",https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/forests/true-price-palm-oil/#resource-library,

Full details of this case is available on IOI’s grievance list.We understand that Finnwatch has engaged with IOI since August 2020, where they have informed IOI of several allegations highlighted by a grievance raiser on behalf of five workers, consisting of: On 2 June 2023, RSPO Complaint Panel who investigated the case has dismissed the case. For more information on RSPO’s deliberation, please refer to the case tracker. Mistreatment from the estate’s supervisor Inconsistency in issuance of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Not allowing workers to speak to auditors Dissatisfaction regarding housing facilities Disagreement in wage payments Alleged payment of recruitment fees Following this, IOI immediately formed an internal investigation team to address the allegations. On 11 September 2020, IOI updated Finnwatch on the matter of mistreatment, issuance of PPE and the worker being disallowed from speaking to auditors. In the update, IOI included explanations on the regular issuance of PPEs, and that in IOI, there was no restriction placed on auditors with regards to who they choose to interview during audits. IOI also disputed the allegation that workers were not allowed to speak with auditors. IOI further acknowledged that there was an incident of mistreatment of a worker by an estate employee and clarified that action had been taken by IOI management against the employee in question. On 14 October 2020, IOI provided supporting documents, photos and videos from its internal investigations to Finnwatch on the issue of wage disagreement, and dissatisfaction regarding housing facilities. On 13 November 2020, IOI informed Finnwatch that on the issue of illegal payments made during recruitment by the aggrieved workers, IOI had made several attempts to contact the person involved but was not successful. On 16 December 2020, IOI presented its “Guideline for Providing Basic Amenities to Workers” which ensures uniform implementation of amenities provided to all estate workers, and a guideline on “Worker’s Work Verification”, which enables workers to verify their working hours. IOI also shared updates with Finnwatch on progress made with regards to workers’ repatriation back to India. On the issue of recruitment fee, IOI provided reassurance to Finnwatch that investigations were ongoing on the matter, in line with IOI’s No Recruitment Fee policy. On 23 February 2021, IOI informed Finnwatch that it had no way of confirming transactions that had occurred in India relating to recruitment fees. In response to the issue however, IOI suspended the recruitment agency involved as well as recruitment of workers from India, and added that it would be reporting the findings to authorities in India for further formal investigation. On 28 June 2021, IOI reiterated that the issue of illegal monies collected from workers in India for recruitment was beyond their jurisdiction and would require cooperation from the Indian government. On 2 July 2021, IOI published a Statement in Response to Finnwatch’s Report addressing the allegations. In the Statement, IOI also reaffirmed commitment to its “No Recruitment Fees Policy” since 2017, highlighted its “Guideline for Minimum Wage & Leave Pay” and “Worker’s Work Verification Guideline”, and mentioned that it will be undergoing an audit on its plantation operating units to ascertain non-compliance with its labour policies or unsatisfactory working conditions. On 21 July 2021, IOI published an update on its first virtual Sustainability Consultation Forum. IOI engaged BSR (Business for Social Responsibility) to develop and facilitate the Forum, which was held in May 2021 and attended by 40 of IOI’s internal and external stakeholders. Discussions at the Forum were centred around efforts to address current labour challenges faced by IOI and the Malaysian palm oil sector, with a specific focus on Responsible Recruitment Practices especially in Peninsular Malaysia and legalisation of undocumented workers in Sabah. An Executive Summary of the Forum can be found here. On 13 January 2022, IOI published a further update on outcomes and action plans arising from the Forum, which includes active engagement with relevant stakeholders such as RSPO and ILO to develop solutions for responsible recruitment practices, and the setting up of a working group to discuss approaches to legalise undocumented workers in Sabah.

We were informed that PT MAS is currently under management takeover. The takeover process has hampered the investigation of the case due to changes in management during the interim period, where the company will take more time to conduct the investigations and compile relevant documentation to be shared with Wilmar. Following ongoing engagements, PT MAS has refuted the allegations and provided clarification to Wilmar on all the issues raised by LemBAH. Wilmar has reviewed PT MAS' response and shared the outcome of our review with the grievance raiser in December 2021. We have also proposed a meeting with the grievance raiser for further discussion on the case. The grievance raiser did not provide further comments to PT MAS’ response. In June 2022, Wilmar carried out a field visit to PT MAS to investigate the allegations. The grievance team conducted document review, as well as interviews with PT MAS and surrounding communities to verify the allegations. The outcome of the field investigation corroborated the clarifications provided to Wilmar. In general, PT MAS is operating legally as they have already obtained all legal permits, including location permit, plantation business permit (IUP) and land use permit (Hak Guna Usaha, HGU). They have also fulfilled their plasma obligations as well as provided compensation for land acquisition to the previous landowner. It is important to note that there are no community settlements, buildings, graves and community houses within the boundaries of PT MAS’s IUP and HGU.

Nieleson Digat Anak Regi used to work at NPOM as an apprentice mechanic but was dismissed in January 2021. His dismissal was related to several prior incidents. On 18 January 2021, NPOM management found Nieleson Digat Anak Regi, who was absent without leave from work, at staff quarters. During a discussion that ensued between both parties, Nieleson Digat Anak Regi threatened management staff with a knife. Through mutual agreement with management staff, Nieleson Digat Anak Regi went to the police station to turn himself in and a report was filed. In a separate incident, a regular urine screen test that was conducted earlier by the company for work compliance found Nieleson Digat Anak Regi had tested positive for Methamphetamine (syabu), an illegal narcotic. Nieleson Digat Anak Regi was dismissed from work thereafter. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, since 9 January 2021, NPOM was put under lockdown. SPB issued a memo to all staff on the lockdown of its estates and mills; the memo included a directive prohibiting all visitors from entering estate/ mill compounds. On 7 February 2021, auxiliary police (AP) received a call from NPOM’s on-duty staff informing him that Nieleson Digat Anak Regi had entered staff quarters after a verbal confrontation and despite being informed that no visitors were allowed on the premises. Nieleson Digat Anak Regi at the time was wanting to visit his relatives that also worked at NPOM. Company staff who later intervened were able to convince him to leave; this action taken was in line with the memo issue by the company earlier. However, company staff later received a call that on his way out of NPOM premises, Nieleson Digat Anak Regi physically assaulted a guard. Company staff and AP rushed to the location of the call to find Nieleson Digat Anak Regi and the said guard engaged in a fight. AP and company staff intervened to break up the fight. Nieleson Digat Anak Regi was handed over to the police station and a report was filed against him. On the same day, he also lodged a police report claiming that he was beaten without reason, resulting in bodily pain. Following this incident, local community members and Nieleson Digat Anak Regi’s grandfather imprisoned and beat up company security guards at the main entrance of a SPB estate on 9 February 2021. The said guards proceeded to lodge a police report on 10 February. In line with due processes, police investigations have been completed and the case will be deliberated in court. The date of the hearing has been fixed for 11 to 15 April 2022.The police department, Polis Diraja Malaysia (PDRM) has issued a media release on the case. PDRM has also made several arrests and the cases are still under investigation. One of our stakeholders who requested for anonymity, officially lodged the case with Wilmar in March 2021. During the course of investigation of this case, SPB shared extensive supporting documents with us, including a clear chronology of events, copies of police reports, as well as internal memos, policies and SOPs. They have provided sufficient clarification on the allegations highlighted in this case, and have committed to enhancing their Code of Ethics and developing procedures to strengthen their commitment to non-violence at the workplace, including detailed SOPs for their security personnel, with assistance from Wilmar. SBP will be translating these SOPs into local languages and has also committed to actively socialise their SOPs with all relevant personnel in the organisation.

SPMN responded by sharing the detailed chronology event of the case, and the bipartite meeting agreement on the settlement of the latest wage calculation scheme introduced by SPMN in March 2020. A teleconference was held with SPMN on 29 April 2020 to further discuss the case. We learnt that there was a new wage calculation for harvesting mandores (field supervisors) that PT SPMN had planned to introduce in in March 2020. During the initial socialisation meeting held on 30 March 2020, SPMN management had intended to provide details and explanations on the new wage calculation scheme. However in the meeting, prior to the full explanation being provided, the chairman of the union Sepasi, Pak Subit, reacted negatively and asked all mandores present to leave the meeting in protest. Due to this, SPMN did not yet introduce the proposed wage structure. Subsequent to the meeting on 30 March, several mandores failed to turn up to work for a few days after the incident without any notice to the company. On 15 April 2020, the management of SPMN held another meeting with the mandores to provide clearer explanation of the new wage calculation scheme. At this meeting, SPMN provided mandores with the option of choosing to maintain the existing wage calculation scheme if they wanted to. Both wage schemes guarantees at least minimum wages for the mandore. From the outcome of the meeting on 15 April, eight out of a total of fourteen mandores opted to switch to the new wage calculation scheme. In addition, a bipartite agreement has been signed between the company and the union representatives, including Pak Subit. Separately, SPMN management issued a letter of termination to Pak Subit due to his behaviour at the 30 March meeting. Additionally, SPMN had also reported the case to the labour department. Wilmar has suggested to SPMN to explore options to resolve the case with Pak Subit, which include further bipartite and/or tripartite engagement with relevant stakeholders, where the first meeting has been planned on 4th May 2020. SPMN, Pak Subit and Sepasi conducted several meetings thereafter to seek resolution to the case. Based on the supporting documents submitted by PT SPMN on 12 May 2020, which includes meeting minute, signed statement from Pak Subit, Agreement between SPMN and Pak Subit as well as PT SPMN’s memo on the resolution of the case, we understand that PT SPMN and Pak Subit has resolved the case amicably, where: PT SPMN has revoked its termination on Pak Subit, where Pak Subit will remain as PT SPMN’s employee and enjoy the same renumeration and benefit as before. Pak Subit has apologised and acknowledged that his behaviour during the meeting on 30th March is inappropriate and has violated the company’s code of conduct/ethic. Pak Subit accepted the sanction from the company where he has been given an official warning letter. Both parties agreed to resolve any future industrial relationship dispute in the manner of bipartite discussion. We have also reached out separately to Pak Subit to confirm the resolution of the case. Pak Subit had agreed to officially close the case once he received his full wages which include the wages during his absence to work when the case was still under the process of resolution. Based on the wage slips that was shared by SPMN to Wilmar, we had verified and confirmed that Pak Subit has been paid the full wages.",https://www.infosawit.com/news/9860/ketua-serikat-buruh-di-perusahaan-kelapa-sawit-pt-smpn-diancam-phk,

BBIP responded by sharing a detailed chronology of the case, minutes of their meeting with communities, supporting documents on their past engagements with communities, as well as their internal SOP on addressing social conflicts. A teleconference was held with BBIP's management on 23 April 2020 to further discuss the case. Based on our investigations, we understand that since the takeover of BBIP by the current shareholding group in 2011, there were no land claims or social conflicts at PT Artha Prigel (AP) with communities from Pagar Batu, until 2018. The community in 2018 were involved in a demonstration, in which they requested for the Government to refrain from renewing PT AP’s Hak Guna Usaha (HGU) or land use permit. This contestation continued in 2019, when PT AP completed its replanting programme and prepared for harvesting. Following this, in 2019, a mediation meeting was held between PT AP and various stakeholders, including the Tim Terpadu, a joint task force comprising government representatives from Lahat Regency, and South Sumatra, the police, the National Land Agency and other related governmental agencies. On-the-ground verification of the contested area of approximately 180 ha was carried out by Tim Terpadu, who confirmed that the said area is within PT AP’s legal permit, as per their HGU. The land conflict was not triggered by the COVID-19 situation. PT AP continued their mediation efforts with the communities but to no avail, and also informed the community of the option of legal recourse. The communities instead chose to set up an illegal blockade at the area to restrict access into the said area. The blockade was put up in late 2019 to forcefully stop PT AP’s workers from accessing the contested area, and was manned by the community with dangerous weapons, including machetes and spears. The blockade was removed in February 2020. On 20 March 2020, the community began gathering at the contested area but was dispersed by PT AP’s security officers. On 21 March 2020, around 70 community members gathered again at the contested area, armed with dangerous weapons such as machetes. These armed community members forcibly stopped PT AP’s workers, who were escorted by police officers present at the time, from entering the area. PT AP’s workers then left the area. Armed community members began attacking PT AP’s security officers soon after, when they attempted to leave the area together with the police officers. This resulted in a clash that only came to a halt when police officers fired warning shots into the air. Unfortunately, there were serious casualties from both sides, including the death of two community members. Subsequently, PT AP lodged a police report on the attack. A PT AP security officer was detained by the police as part of the investigations. Following advice from the police, PT AP initiated discussion with the families of both victims to explore provisions of compensation. For more information related to the background of the case, please refer to PT AP's official response to Wilmar. In June 2020, PT AP’s security officer, who was the defendant in the case involving the death of community members was found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment by the courts. The authorities are still on the search for another PT AP security officer, who was also involved in the case. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our team was unable to conduct any field verification but continued engaging with PT AP through virtual meetings. We also supported PT AP in developing a SOP and Policy to strengthen their internal processes in managing land conflicts. Additionally, Wilmar appointed an independent third-party consultant to conduct field verifications to support Wilmar in seeking a resolution for this issue. On 17 March 2021, Wilmar was alerted that community members had received various police summons linked to a police report lodged by PT AP’s staff. Wilmar immediately contacted PT AP to seek clarification on the police report. PT AP claimed it was part of their efforts to resolve the social conflict via a legal avenue. In April 2021, Wilmar was further alerted that a report had also been lodged against an NGO, associated with Komite Reforma Agraria Sumsel (KRASS). An event held by a coalition of local activists on 25 April 2021 also revealed that the police report implicated the Chairman of KRASS. Wilmar has then ceased purchase, where our last purchase from BBIP was on 26 April 2021, while we continue to guide them towards the resolution of the case and re-entry into Wilmar’s supply chain. In May 2022, BBIP has fulfilled the re-entry requirements, as stipulated in Wilmar’s No Exploitation Protocol for Third-Party Suppliers. This includes engagement and dialogue as well as settlement with head of KRASS, the NGO which a police report had been lodged against; review of the company’s human rights related policies and SOPs; and human rights trainings conducted for internal staff to raise awareness on human rights principles, including on the protection of the rights of Human Rights Defenders (HRDs). Based on the detailed review of documentation, continued engagement with BBIP, as well as BBIP’s commitment to undertake corrective measures and remediation at Group level, the Wilmar Suspension Committee has given due consideration of this progress and lifted the suspension of BBIP in May 2022. Wilmar continues to engage with BBIP and guide them towards improving their practices, in line with Wilmar’s NDPE commitments.",http://lahatpos.co/polisi-ringkus-terduga-pelaku-insiden-warga-pagar-batu-vs-arta-prigel/,

Based on the supporting document submitted by supplier, it was clarified that the deforestation happened outside their concession boundary. PMI did not carry out any land clearing inside their concession for oil palm development. First meeting with PMI was conducted in May 2019, where Wilmar has reiterated the NDPE policy compliance. PMI had also provided written confirmation to the commitment of NDPE policy and shared their concession map for our ongoing monitoring.We continue to monitor the case and our internal monitoring report in October 2019 has detected land clearing at PT PMI. During our investigation and engagement with PMI, it was clarified that the area has already being felled several years ago and now being cleared for planting. However, as there was no HCS/HCV assessment conducted, we considered this as a non-compliant to the NDPE policy. PMI has committed to immediate moratorium and we continue to guide PMI in NDPE policy compliance.Due to non-compliance to the NDPE policy, we have ceased sourcing from QL Group of companies where the last purchase was in November 2019. Several meetings have taken place since then to guide QL Group of companies to the compliance of NDPE policy and meeting the re-entry criteria.A field visit to PT PMI was conducted in January 2020 to assess the situation on the ground and develop an action plan for PT PMI to close the gaps identified during the field visit. In April 2020, QL Group has met all the criteria stipulated in the re-entry criteria, including their commitment to the development of Recovery Plan for Non-Compliant Land Clearing in line with the NDPE policy at group level incurred from January 2016 onwards.Based on detailed review of documentation, reports and letter of commitment from QL Group, the Wilmar Suspension Committee gave due consideration of this progress and lifted the suspension on QL Group in April 2020. In 2020, PT PMI developed a recovery plan that focused on the rehabilitation of river buffers, conservation of unplanted areas, and training on firefighting and fire prevention for local communities. PT PMI began the implementation of this recovery initiative since October 2021. In June 2023, Wilmar conducted a field visit to PT PMI to assess the progress of the recovery plan. The visit confirmed that PT PMI has established the nursery, installed river buffer signboards, carried out active planting of 622 tree seedlings, and conducted outreach on firefighting and fire prevention for the local community.",http://www.mightyearth.org/wp-content/uploads/Rapid-Response-Report-21_final_v2.pdf,
370,Wilmar International,,Closed,11/4/2019,,,,,Forest Peoples Programme (FPP); Nagari Institute; Yayasan Masyarakat Kehutanan Lestari,Multiple companies (West Sumatra),,,,Allegations of land rights and labour rights violations in oil palm concessions area in West Sumatra,"Initial checks on the list of suppliers indicated that PT Tidar Kerinchi Agung is not Wilmar’s supplier. PT Karya Agung Mega Utama (PT KAMU) is not a subsidiary under Wilmar International. The issues listed in the interim report are generic and similar for all groups. This makes verification of these allegations challenging until specific issues can be made available – to enable the issue to be properly addressed. Some of the cases are already logged into the RSPO Complaints mechanism. More details can be found here (Reference no: RSPO/2018/12/RB, RSPO/2018/06/RB, RSPO/2018/07/SW, R76). Wilmar commissioned Earthworm Foundation (EF) in September 2018 to conduct a thorough evaluation of issues raised against Wilmar's internal systems on social grievance and resolution at three of its subsidiaries in Pasaman Barat in West Sumatra - PT AMP Plantation, PT Gersindo Minang Plantation (GMP) and PT Primatama Mulia Jaya (PMJ). More details can be found here and here. Since November 2019, we have reached out to all the supplier companies to seek clarification on the allegations as part of the investigation. Our initial preliminary investigations did not identify noncompliance’s raised in the interim report. However, it is important to note that as the issue listed in the interim report are generic and similar for all groups, Wilmar is unable to verify the cases without knowing the specific issues from the complainant. Wilmar had a meeting with FPP and Nagari Institute in November 2019 in Bangkok and it was agreed that a follow up meeting would be held to further discuss the issues and possible resolutions. A meeting with Nagari Institute in Padang on 11 February 2020 was held, and it was reiterated that in order to clearly seek resolution, it was important for Nagari Institute and FPP to provide more details in order for us to further investigate the cases and work towards the resolution. This did not need to have specific persons identified, rather details on the specific allegations. Nagari Institute was unable to share more information beyond the original interim report. However, there was agreement to continue with a follow up meeting with Nagari Institute in March 2020. The meeting in March 2020 unfortunately has been postponed due to covid-19 pandemic. Wilmar continues to engage with both Nagari Institute and FPP, while in the meantime transparently report on progress of our programme with EF in Pasaman Barat: Earthworm Foundation Report 6: Wilmar's Operation Linked to Pasaman Barat Community, West Sumatra (Final report, May 2022) Earthworm Foundation Report 5: Wilmar's Operations Linked to Pasaman Barat Community, West Sumatra (May 2021) Earthworm Foundation Report 5: Wilmar's Operations Linked to Pasaman Barat Community, West Sumatra (May 2021) - Bahasa Indonesia Earthworm Foundation Report 4: Wilmar's Operations Linked to Pasaman Barat Community, West Sumatra (September 2020) Earthworm Foundation Report 4: Wilmar's Operations Linked to Pasaman Barat Community, West Sumatra (September 2020) - Bahasa Indonesia Earthworm Foundation Report 3: Wilmar's Operations Linked to Pasaman Barat Community, West Sumatra (April 2020) Earthworm Foundation Report 2: Wilmar's Operations Linked to Pasaman Barat Community, West Sumatra (February 2020) Earthworm Foundation Report 1: Wilmar’s Operations Linked to Pasaman Barat Community, West Sumatra (November 2019) In general, EF reported the complexity caused by the dynamics in the society in Pasaman region, which are influenced by social changes, customs, traditions, and even changes in the political landscape – for example, traditional leaders with different customary beliefs. This undoubtedly becomes a challenge in resolving grievances and conflicts because we have to ensure that any disputes, especially those of a tenurial nature, must be resolved with the rightful customary leaders and in accordance with the appropriate customary laws and practices. Some of these internal issues, although following customary process, are not well documented and can lead to confusion. Examples of resolution of such cases are provided in the above reports. It is also important to highlight that, since August 2020, EF has been assisting in the development of the procedure to improve the effectiveness of the grievance handling process at Wilmar's subsidiary companies at the unit level. The scope of Wilmar’s unit level community and local grievance handling process covers all complaints originating from external stakeholders at local level regarding social, environmental and policy implementation related to the impact of operational activities in Wilmar's subsidiaries. This process is in line with Wilmar's broader efforts at the group level, such as the update of the No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation (NDPE) policy and Grievance Procedure in 2019, as well as the launch of the No Exploitation protocol developed in partnership with labour and land rights expert organizations such as Verite, EF, and Landesa. In June 2021, this draft procedure was discussed with the field team in the Pasaman region to ensure that it is feasible and can be easily understood. During the design and development of this grievance procedure, the EF team also conducted informal consultations with: Ninik Mamak Kinali, Ninik Mamak Koto Baru, Ninik Mamak Sasak and Nagari Institute to gather feedback and inputs to refine and finalize the procedure. Internal socialization and training on the implementation of Grievance Handling procedure were concluded in September 2021.",https://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/default/files/documents/Report%20on%20Wilmar%20Affected%20Communities%20in%20West%20Sumatra%20Nov%202019.pdf,

First meeting was conducted in June 2019 where RPR met with Wilmar together with Aidenvironment to understand the issues raised on their operation. RPR has agreed to commit to moratorium in July 2019 and ceased all land clearing until all relevant assessment has been carried out. RPR has also submitted to Wilmar their written commitment to the NDPE policy. During our ongoing monitoring and verification of the case, we have detected further land clearing activities inside RPR’s concession in August 2019. A meeting was held with RPR in September 2019 to seek clarification on the land clearing, and we understand that the land clearing was carried out by RPR’s contractors, who wanted to complete their contracts after RPR communicated their moratorium intent to them. RPR has reiterated their moratorium request to their contractor and no land clearing was detected thus far. RPR has already reached out to HCV/HCS assessor to arrange for all the necessary assessments prior to continuing land development. RPR has also provided their concessions maps to Wilmar in October 2019 for ongoing monitoring. We will continue to guide RPR in NDPE policy compliance.

The report alleged human rights abuses on plantations in Indonesia, including forced labour and child labour, gender discrimination, as well as exploitative and dangerous working practices that put health of workers at risk. The report implicated Wilmar’s supplier, PT Sarana Prima Multi Niaga (PT SPMN), a wholly owned entity under TSH Group. Wilmar immediately reached out to PT SPMN to seek clarification on the allegations. On 20 December 2016, Wilmar and its consultant TFT (now known as Earthworm Foundation), met with PT SPMN to discuss the allegations raised in the AI’s report in further detail. Separately, PT SPMN has been engaged within various RSPO processes since early 2017 subsequent to the publication of the report. The engagement between RSPO and PT SPMN on the allegations are summarized are follows: • On 22 March 2017, RSPO first contacted TSH regarding a response to AI’s report. • On 20 November 2017, TSH Sustainability Team presented progress report on Corrective Actions taken to address AI’s findings to the RSPO. • In November 2017, RSPO commissioned Profundo, a non-for-profit organization, to conduct an independent labor assessment in PT SPMN. The objective of the assessment was to evaluate labor practices and identify any areas for improvement. The assessment was carried out from 27 to 28 November 2017. • On 7 February 2018, Profundo produced a report on the assessment's findings. On 29 May 2018, PT SPMN appointed MEC as an independent party to review and strengthen their action plan including monitoring of issues raised in the AI’s November 2016 report. Actions initiated by PT SPMN to address Profundo’s initial findings were noted and assessed by MEC. In September 2018, Time Bound Action Plan was developed and was subsequently submitted to RSPO for review. The Time Bound Action Plan includes corrective action for both Group and Estate Level Management. The time frame identified for this management exercise to be effective is 16 months, starting from September 2018 and ending in December 2019. The management actions were presented and discussed with the company at both estate and group levels prior to finalizing the action plan. The company initiated implementation of the actions early September 2018, and independent monitoring is to be undertaken by MEC every 4 months.

However, as there was no HCS/HCV assessment conducted prior, we considered this to be a non-compliance to our NDPE policy. Based on our analysis, close to 200ha of deforestation has taken place post 2019. Wilmar’s last purchase from this supplier was in April 2020. As of February 2021, APSL has met all the requirements stipulated in our re-entry criteria. This includes their commitment to the development of a Recovery Plan for Non-Compliant Land Clearing to the NDPE policy at group level, for activity that has taken place from January 2016 onwards. Based on the detailed review of documentation, reports and a letter of commitment from APSL, the Wilmar Suspension Committee has given due consideration of this progress and lifted the suspension of APSL in February 2021.",,

On 17 December 2017, Greenpeace shared with Wilmar information on 16 companies with alleged non-compliance to NDPE requirements. The case report provided some details of deforestation allegations, such as map outlines and names of concessions. PT KAP was also identified as having been involved in deforestation activities. In March 2018, AEP appointed PT Meganesia Tirta Foresta to conduct a HCS assessment at PT KAP; field assessment was conducted in April 2018. More details are available here: http://www.angloeastern.co.uk/~/media/Files/A/Anglo-Eastern/documents/HCV%20and%20Scared%20Tribal%20Sites.pdf The HCS assessment was completed in July 2018 and the finalised version of the HCS assessment report was shared with Wilmar in October 2018. Upon completion of the HCS assessment, PT KAP resumed their land development activities outside the identified HCS area. The HCS assessment was conducted using the V 1.0 toolkit and carried out independently of the HCV, SIA and FPIC processes. The other assessments and processes were done either prior, in parallel or after the HCS assessment was completed. The outcome of these assessments was then integrated with the HCS assessment results. In January 2019, PT KAP notified Wilmar that they had submitted the HCS report for peer review. The process was completed in November 2019. The HCSA peer review report is available here: http://highcarbonstock.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/HCSA-Peer-Review-Report-PT-KAP-Final-Response-271119.pdf In June 2019, AEP has also published their Group's NDPE policy.",https://www.mightyearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Mighty-Earth-Rapid-Response-Report-1.pdf,

The allegations against FGV, coupled with other labour and human rights issues within the Malaysian palm oil industry raised by concerned stakeholders prompted the RSPO Secretariat to consider conducting an independent assessment on the competency of RSPO Certification Bodies in identifying non-compliances related to such issues – please refer to RSPO’s statement here.Wilmar has initiated dialogue with FGV on first week of August 2015. A meeting was further held with FGV on 10 August 2015 to understand the matters and provide recommendation to FGV to address the concern raised by stakeholders. On 14 August, RSPO had announced that they have engaged Accreditation Services International (ASI) to perform a compliance audit in September on a few FGV units located in the area linked to the findings in the report. Additionally, FGV engaged an independent consultant to conduct their own investigation into these allegations. In August 2015, FGV published a second statement, which provided further clarification on the allegations and action points. On 26 October 2015, RSPO has registered this case as an official complaint. Progress updates are available here. Wilmar conducted several meetings with FGV thereafter, and provided inputs for the development of their sustainability policy, which was released in August 2016. In April 2018, FGV announced the enhancement of its NDPE commitments, where they would adopt the NDPE policy for all of their concessions, irrespective of when the land was acquired or whether any prior RSPO New Planting Procedure approvals were granted.

On 8 October 2020, a conference call between FGV and the CBP was held. CBP could not reveal any information about its findings, except that its research had identified 11 International Labour Organization (ILO) indicators of forced labour in FGV’s practices. CBP informed FGV that it would consider a petition for the revocation of the WRO, together with information or reports arising from audits from credible, unbiased, third-party auditing firms. More information on FGV’s engagements with CBP is available here.Subsequently, FGV also published the FLA Assessment Report on the Implementation of FGV’s Action Plan and their Progress Report (October 2020) Pertaining to RSPO’s Complaints Panel’s Directives.On 18 November 2020, The Associated Press (AP) published an article titled “Rape, abuses in palm oil fields linked to top beauty brands”, which reported alleged abuse of women in several oil palm plantations in Malaysia and Indonesia, including that of FGV’s. FGV published a statement responding to the article stating that they viewed the alleged findings as a matter of serious concern, and reiterated their commitment to respecting human rights and upholding labour standards. On 27 January 2021, FGV published its first sustainability updates for the year, highlighting that it had revised its Group Sustainability Policy in consultation with its stakeholders. On 31 March 2021, FGV announced an update on its sustainability efforts, to address US CBP’s WRO.

The report contains details on progress made between September 2020 and March 2021 and highlights key areas that will remain a priority for the company in 2021; this includes FGV’s grievance mechanism, remediation procedures and worker representation structures. On 1 July 2021, FGV published an update on its sustainability efforts. FGV is to undergo an Independent External Assessment (IEA) which will serve as a baseline examination of FGV’s implementation of labour policies and practices on the ground. The IEA is scheduled to be conducted by FLA-accredited monitors in the third quarter of 2021, subject to the COVID-19 situation, findings from which will be addressed by FGV through a Corrective Action Plan. In addition, following the re-suspension of FGV’s Serting Mill in January 2020, a verification audit was conducted by RSPO between November 2020 and April 2021. FGV is currently waiting on a decision on the status of the said suspension from the RSPO Complaints Panel. A further statement on FGV’s progress in addressing the WRO was published on 18 June 2021. FGV reiterated its sustainability commitments and highlighted several initiatives that are being implemented, focused on improving its migrant worker recruitment process, developing human rights capacity building and training programmes, as well as strengthening its grievance mechanisms and enhancing labour monitoring systems. FGV is in the midst of planning for an assessment of its operations against ILO’s 11 Indicators of Forced Labour and following the publication of an updated statement, is expecting to finalise the appointment of an independent auditor in September 2021. FGV has also appointed a US-based legal firm to provide support for its efforts in addressing the WRO.

On 20 October 2021, FGV announced delays in the appointment of the independent auditor. Further to this, on 16 November 2021, FGV announced that following a review of proposals from several organisations, the company had finalised the appointment of ELEVATE, an experienced supply chain service provider, to carry out the audit, scheduled for November 2021. On 19th August 2022, FGV Holdings Berhad (FGV) had announced that based on the recently published Independent External Assessment (IEA) Report by the Fair Labor Association (FLA), no non-compliances are identified based on FLA’s forced labour benchmarks and found no evidence of child labour at FGV Holdings Berhad (FGV) operations. The report also recognizes that progress has been made by FGV including its top management’s commitment, policy alignment with international and national standards, and engagement with civil society organizations, especially at the headquarters level. FGV’s affiliation to FLA is subjected to independent assessment, validation and reporting by the FLA. In addition to this IEA report, FLA had also published its first and second validation report in October 2020 and April 2021 respectively. FGV, in consultation with FLA, has developed a comprehensive corrective action plan (CAP) to address and resolve all findings arising from the IEA. Many of the action items have already been implemented and relevant resources are identified to close the remaining gaps. In keeping with the principle of transparency, FLA’s IEA report together with FGV’s CAP is published on FLA’s website. On 28 February 2023, FGV issued a press release stating that Elevate has concluded its on-site assessments and FGV is implementing Elevate ‘s recommendations and anticipates submitting the final report to CBP in the near future. Aligned with their No Recruitment Fees policy, FGV will reimburse its current and former foreign workers, who were employed after 27 June 2019 and had to pay recruitment fees to agents or other third parties in their countries of origin. The payment to the foreign workers will be made in three tranches between March and September 2023. The payment to their current 23,333 foreign workers amounting to RM81.64 million will be made in three tranches between March and September 2023.

On 10 January 2024, FGV announced that total of RM72.2 million has been reimbursed to 19,673 workers. FGV appointed LRQA, formerly known as ELEVATE to conduct a verification of the reimbursement exercise. LRQA is expected to conduct its follow-up assessment in the first quarter of 2024 which is to verify the implementation of FGV’s overall remediation plan. With the outcome of the assessment, FGV will then prepare a petition to the CBP to modify the WRO, which will be submitted by the end of the second quarter of 2024. On 30 June 2024, FGV submitted its petition to CBP for the modification of the WRO, after significant remediation efforts across its operations towards ensuring labour rights and improving the welfare of workers.",https://www.wsj.com/articles/palm-oil-migrant-workers-tell-of-abuses-on-malaysian-plantations-1437933321,

402,Wilmar International,,Closed,9/27/2016,,,,,Greenpeace,"Persada Kencana Prima, a subsidiary of TH Plantations Berhad (THP)",,,,,"Prior to the report being published by Greenpeace, Wilmar has initiated engagement with TH Plantations Berhad (THP) since August 2016, following the Group’s monitoring activity that brought the alleged issues to the Group’s attention. Wilmar met with THP on 10 October 2016, where Wilmar re-emphasised its Policy and sought clarification on the allegations. THP informed that they had ceased land clearing activities for several months for operational reasons. A meeting was further held with the management of THP on 2 June 2017, where the management of THP has agreed to a suspension on further land-clearing while THP review next steps for the said area. Wilmar conducted a joint site visit with TFT to PT Persada Kencana Prima (PKP) from 31 July – 4 August 2017 to assess the situation on the ground and develop an action plan for the area. Wilmar’s team met with THP’s management on 6 November 2017 to share the assessment report. While Wilmar continues to follow up with THP on improvement on their sustainability practices, the moratorium on land clearing is still in place at PT PKP. Through our monitoring, we have detected land use change at PT PKP in early July 2018. THP clarified that the area was originally cleared several years ago but was not planted due to operational constraints. THP claimed that the land use change detected is due the re-stacking of area now that planting is resuming. We have met with THP’s management on 17 July 2018 to seek further details on the re-stacking activities and in the meantime, PT PKP has ceased all stacking activities on the ground. In order to be absolutely clear that there is no violation to the NDPE policies, PT PKP has provided further information requested by Wilmar, ie: time and GPS stamped photographs, drone footages, etc. for Wilmar's further investigation. A meeting was held with the supplier on 12 September 2018 to further discuss the evidences submitted by PT PKP. PT PKP has agreed to hire TFT to conduct assessment of the area of contention, together with Wilmar’s team. A proposed rehabilitation plan will be established if there is indeed new land clearing. The joint field assessment was carried out from 15 – 19 October 2018. According to the verification findings, TFT identified the highest and most immediate priority for PT PKP is to stop the Wood Utilisation Permit (IPK, Ijin Pemanfaatan Kayu) felling activities by PT Usaha Mandiri Sesayap (PT UMS), a logging company that has license to conduct logging, in these IPK areas and the local communities for entire concession area. Should such activities continue, they will be perceived as a risk of deforestation due to the use of heavy machinery to remove the logs. While PT PKP committed not to utilise/plant on the area felled by PT UMS, they are unable to stop the felling activities by PT UMS as PT UMS hold the IPK rights to fell inside PT PKP. Understand the complexity of the issue, Wilmar has bridged a meeting between Aidenvironment and PT PKP in March 2019 and May 2019 to explore possible avenues in addressing the IPK issues. Following the meetings, PT PKP has officially engaged and issued letters to PT UMS in seeking PT UMS to cease all felling activities inside PT PKP. Their engagement yielded positive results and there was no deforestation detected from June 2019 onwards. PT PKP continues to uphold their commitment to cease all activities on the ground. In the meantime, engagement with THP in relation to our re-entry criteria has been triggered since July 2020 in relation to a case in Deru Semangat Sdn Bhd.

403,Wilmar International,,Closed,7/21/2017,,,,,Rainforest Action Network (RAN),Ensem Sawita,,,,,"Wilmar has mapped all suppliers who operate mills within a 50-km radius of the Leuser Ecosystem, and engaged directly with all these suppliers to ensure that we have clearly communicated our NDPE Policy requirements to all suppliers who may be at risk of sourcing from illegal or protected areas within the Leuser Ecosystem. Most recently in April 2017, we have also checked and confirmed that all these suppliers, including PT Ensem Sawita (ES) were not sourcing from PT Agra Bumi Niaga (ABN). Following RAN’s latest report, we contacted PT ES for clarifications and were informed that PT ES was not aware that their FFB supplier PT. Putri Hijau was acquired by PT ABN. Therefore, PT ABN’s FFB may have entered PT ES’s supply chain through PT Putri Hijau. Wilmar met with PT ES on 28 July 2017, PT ES informed that they have ceased sourcing from PT ABN since early July 2017 when they were alerted that PT ABN’s fruits had entered their supply chain. PT ES decided not to resume purchase from PT ABN until this FFB supplier has been assessed and implemented the necessary corrective actions as per recommended by an independent assessor. Together with TFT, one of PT ES’s buyers has scheduled a site visit to the operations of PT ES & PT ABN in early August 2017. To avoid duplicating the same assessment, PT ES has agreed to share the assessment report with Wilmar for our deliberation of next course of action. The field assessment report has been shared with Wilmar in October 2017 and we have met with PT ES on 17 November 2017 to follow up with them on their progress. While PT ES is committed to close the gaps identified during the assessment, we continue to monitor their progress, which includes regular physical meetings with PT ES where we will provide support to improve their sourcing practices.

A few more meetings were held thereafter. Wilmar has put on hold purchases, where our last purchase was in 9 July 2015 pending resolution of this matter to Wilmar’s satisfaction. Mopoli Raya had engaged a registered consultant in September 2015 to conduct HCS preliminary study and HCV pre-identification study in 2015 as per Wilmar’s recommendation at PT Aloer Timur. A total area of around 1200 ha as HCS areas was identified and the assessment report was shared with Wilmar in February 2016. Mopoli Raya has committed to adhere to the recommendations made by the consultant and continue to adhere to the moratorium which has been put in place since July 2015. However, based on Wilmar’s ongoing desktop monitoring, land clearing was detected in the HCS areas. PT Aloer Timur clarified that the land clearing was a result of illegal encroachment. Wilmar met with Mopoli Raya on 17 March 2017 and 28 July 2017 to discuss the community encroachment challenges in their concession. Together with Earthworm Foundation (EF), Wilmar conducted two field visits to PT Aloer Timur in December 2017 and April 2018 to verify the situation on the ground. Based on the visits result, it was confirmed that deforestation since 2015 was carried out by external parties who were not part of the local community and had illegally occupied PT Aloer Timur’s land permit area and undertaken illegal logging. Wilmar has agreed to provide assistance to guide PT Aloer Timur in addressing the issues of illegal occupation which contributed to the ongoing deforestation, where Wilmar and EF will carry out a facilitation program at PT Aloer Timur. Through this program, which has commenced since November 2018, Wilmar and EF has planned to visit PT Aloer Timur four times over nine months and at each visit, Wilmar and EF will carry out work to help improving PT Aloer Timur’s capacity and provide strategic guidance to implement the action plan. With the commencement of the facilitation program, Wilmar has resumed business relationship with Mopoli Raya. The first facilitation visit was undertaken on 27 November -3 December 2018, here is the executive summary in English and Bahasa. Building on our NDPE commitment, Wilmar continuously strives to support our suppliers to align their practices with ours towards the journey of compliance.

Wilmar has offered its assistance to KPJ to verify the allegations raised by RAN on PT KPJ’s Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB) supplier, PT. Agra Bumi Niaga’s (ABN) operation in and around the Leuser Ecosystem. KPJ has decided to put on hold purchases from PT ABN. Wilmar’s team conducted a field assessment on PT KPJ during 10 – 11 July 2017, and verified that KPJ has not sourced from PT ABN since February 2017. After the field assessment, we have provided further support to PT KPJ by developing a Support for Transformation Programme (SFT), focussing in improving KPJ’s sourcing practices.

We immediately reached out to Konfederasi Serikat Buruh Sejahtera Indonesia (KSBSI), the workers union who organised the meetings for SOMO's researcher with PT MSS’s workers in January 2017. Wilmar met with the Chairman and Secretary General of DPP F Hukatan, as well as the Vice President of KSBSI on 13 January 2017, at KSBSI’s office in Jakarta. At the meeting, we sought to gain more understanding of KSBSI’s field visit and to address any concerns that may have arisen from it. The outcome of the meeting was very positive where Wilmar accepted KSBSI’s proposal to support the union in extending their network in our refinery operations, as well as providing them avenue to provide PPE training to Wilmar’s staff in various locations. On 10 May, Wilmar was given the opportunity to review the draft report from SOMO following their interview with our workers in January. Upon receipt of the draft report content, we immediately conduct internal field verification on the allegations. Based on the outcome of the 2 field verification, we have responded to SOMO, and clarified the allegations and provided input to correct several factually wrong information at the draft report. Please see Wilmar’s detail responses to the draft here. Wilmar has also met with SOMO in Amsterdam on 4 July 2017 to establish direct engagement with CNV, and their research partner, Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO). In our ongoing engagements with KSBSI - Hukatan, Wilmar has recently accepted their invitation to speak at their training event on Industrial Relations and Worker’s Right, in Riau, from 16-17 July 2017. Wilmar’s Industrial Relations Manager, Mr. Feberianta Ginting, together with the Head of Industrial Relations Supervision Division of the Manpower Office of Bengkalis Regency, the Head of Social Insurance Administration Organization (Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial, BPJS) Dumai Branch, and the Head of KSBSI-HUKATAN were the speakers at the training event. Representatives from PT MSS also attended the training sessions to gain more insight on provisions of unions, the national health insurance scheme, as well as national regulations applicable in the field of industrial relation. As of end December 2017, Wilmar has carried out three similar co-training sessions on workers’ rights and improving industrial relations. Wilmar’s ongoing positive engagements with HUKATAN resulted in the establishment of a Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) on 31 October 2017 for our palm oil mill at PT Bumi Pratama Khatulistiwa, where we have adopted the KSBSI-HUKATAN multiple site work agreement template for our workers there. In early 2018, CNV filmed at PT MSS and speak to our workers on camera. The video produced wholly by CNV is available in English and Bahasa Indonesia. In June 2018, Wilmar has published a case Study on how Collective Action with CNV & HukatanKSBSI Makes Positive Impact in Labour Improvements.

409,Wilmar International,,Closed,11/11/2014,,,,,Rainforest Action Network (RAN),Multiple Suppliers (Leuser Ecosystem),,,,Alleged threats to the biodiversity of Leuser Ecosystem Potential forest clearance and impacts on biodiversity,"A meeting was held with RAN on 19 November 2014 to discuss the report and understand the issues raised by RAN. Wilmar has identified mills in its supply chain which might be at risk of sourcing fresh fruits bunches (FFB) illegally from the Leuser Ecosystem, and completed a risk assessment on those mills. Following the said risk assessments, dialogues with high priority suppliers commenced and the risk assessment was used to facilitate field assessments with those suppliers with the aim of achieving full compliance with Wilmar’s Policy. This process is known as the Aggregator Refinery Transformation (ART) plan, a collective and regional approach to addressing supplier non-compliance. It is a more effective way to drive transformation and effect real change on the ground; a detailed explanation on our ART plan is available on our website: https://www.wilmar-international.com/sustainability/supply-chain-transformation Progress updates are available here. As part of our ART programme, we have: 1) identified and conducted field assessments on high priority suppliers supplying to our Kuala Tanjung refinery and Paya Pasir kernel crushing plant which included those operating in and around the Leuser Ecosystem. We visited 14 third-party supplier mills and one Wilmar mill in 2015. 2) Consolidated the findings and summarised them into an anonymised report known as the ""Overarching Report"" for sharing with all suppliers supplying into that refinery and kernel crushing plant. The report was uploaded on our website in June 2016: https://www.wilmar-international.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/highlights/sustainability/2016/07/kuala-tanjung-and-paya-pasir-refinery-overarching-report-english-final.pdf?sfvrsn=30842157_2 3) Shared the findings of the assessments and recommendations on improvements with our suppliers from that region through a workshop, which was held in Medan in October 2016. Wilmar also organised a series of one-day regional-specific trainings in 2017, which were open to all of our suppliers and their suppliers, as well as any interested growers in the region. The trainings were focused on the following topics: I. Environment – land use planning/ management, HCS/HCV, peat management and environmental impact management. II. Fair Labour Practices - Employment Contracts, Child Labour, Access to Remedy, Freedom of Association, Harassment, etc. III Community – Conflict Resolution, FPIC, Land Tenure, Social Impact. On 15 December 2016, Wilmar announced its commitment to addressing the deforestation challenge in the Leuser Ecosystem by becoming part of an existing multi-stakeholder process involving the Aceh Singkil and Aceh Tamiang governments, two districts within the Leuser Ecosystem under the “Areal Prioritas Transformasi (APT)” program. This process was in collaboration with GAR, Musim Mas, as well as Apical, TFT and IDH. More information on Wilmar’s Collaborative Landscape Approach can be found here. In July 2020, we rolled out the Leuser Supplier Reporting Tool (LSRT) to all our direct suppliers operating within the 50km radius of the Leuser Ecosystem, where our suppliers were required to fill in a series of questions related to their operations and sourcing practices. We have also shared the list of high risk plantations operating in the region with these direct suppliers, and sought their response on their exposure to those high risk companies. Suppliers who declined to participate in this programme have already been removed from our supply chain, where we can only resume purchase after they have completed the said questionnaire. So far, all our direct suppliers operating within a 50km radius from the Leuser Ecosystem has confirmed that they are not sourcing from the identified high risk companies within the Leuser Ecosystem. A follow-up webinar has also been conducted for the suppliers and their FFB suppliers on 4 November 2020, to raise their awareness on the importance of protecting the Leuser Ecosystem through NDPE commitments. Apart from Wilmar, key speakers included Mr. M. Daud, S. Hut as Head of Protection and Conservation of Natural Resources, Environmental Service (Kabid Perlindungan dan Konservasi Sumber Daya Alam, Dinas Lingkungan Hidup), Mr. Rudi Putra, Advisor of Forum Konservasi Leuser, and a representative from a FMCG company.

The Forest Trust (TFT) conducted an assessment of the REPSA mill and a representation of the mills’ supply base from 16 –21 November 2015. A follow-up visit took place in April 2016 where TFT met with REPSA’s executive management to discuss the development of an action plan to address the issues identified in the field visit. REPSA submitted to Wilmar a detailed time-bound action plan which they have published a summary on their website. In addition, REPSA also announced two important policies: 1) zero tolerance on violence and intimidation and 2) responsible palm oil production. Both had undergone public consultation. Wilmar’s key recommended action points to REPSA can be found here. Wilmar met with the REPSA management on 24 August 2016 again for updates on the allegations of river pollution and kidnapping, as well as to review the progress of their action plan. REPSA confirmed that there are still no formal charges filed against them concerning both allegations. In particular, the governmental investigation relating to the river pollution allegation is still ongoing, with no clear timeline. REPSA has shown progress on the following fronts: a) the adoption of zero tolerance on violence policy and responsible palm oil production policy; b) engagement with NGOs; c) publication of summary action plan; d) publication of first progress report in September 2016. In late 2016, TFT and the Consensus Building Institute (CBI) visited Sayaxché in Guatemala to jointly carry out a social-scoping exercise to assess the willingness of local stakeholders to participate in a participatory process for dialogue and resolution. A second visit was conducted in February/ March 2017 to socialise the results of the social scoping exercise with the local stakeholders. REPSA appreciated the views, insights and recommendations presented, and have committed to considering collaborations with stakeholder groups to address them, where relevant. Links to the Scoping Report and Addendum . REPSA released their second action plan progress report in February 2017. On 21 April 2017, Wilmar received a letter from a coalition of NGOs, alleging that REPSA has disrupted a meeting convened by the International Observer Mission for Human Rights in November 2016, and that a police report on the alleged incident has been filed. We immediately sought clarification from REPSA who informed that they were not aware of and not responsible for the happenings. Nonetheless, REPSA committed to fully cooperate with the authorities in the investigation of this case – see REPSA’s response here. On 17 May 2017, REPSA released their third and final progress report on the Year 1 Action Plan. TFT conducted another monitoring field visit from 8 May 2017 to 12 May 2017 to assess their progress on key activities stipulated in the 12-month Action Plan. The final 12 -month monitoring report can be found here. By taking into consideration of the recommendations from the 12-month monitoring report, feedback from REPSA clients, and priorities identified by several key stakeholders, REPSA has drafted an 18-month action plan (July 2017 – December 2018) to guide their next steps. The four short-term outcomes that REPSA are focussing, including: 1) Reach a credible, mutually-agreed upon resolution to the 2015 kidnapping incident, 2) Reach a credible, mutually-agreed upon resolution to the November 2016 allegations of intimidation, 3) Develop a Year 2 Action Plan that incorporates stakeholder input and has active stakeholder buy-in and support, and 4) In consultation with local organizations and communities, develop a detailed participatory roadmap for advancing stakeholder engagement. Although REPSA has begun implementing this new 18th-month action plan, they continue to seek input from local stakeholders to improve the action plan and priorities. In the meantime, they are also exploring opportunities to seek key stakeholder’s participation in monitoring their progress.The first 4-month progress report on the 18-month action plan, including the above mentioned short-term outcomes, is expected to be published in November 2017. Wilmar has also been closely in contact with several NGOs who has signed the joint letter, with the aim to bring transparency in the process and improve communication between different parties involved. Wilmar has been actively engaging with REPSA in seeking resolution to the grievances, our recent meetings with REPSA was on 4 October 2017, in Guatemala and 27 November 2017, in Bali. While REPSA has made progress in improving their practices, they have not met our expectations in meeting the agreed time bound action plan. Therefore, Wilmar has decided to put on hold purchases from REPSA, where our last purchase was in December 2017. In the meantime, Wilmar continues to engage and support REPSA in the journey towards the grievance resolution and the implementation of their sustainability policies. REPSA has also published their Sustainability Plan and updated progress report regularly on their website. Latest reports are as follow: Sustainability Action Plan 2022 Sustainability Dashboard Report 1 - 2021 Sustainability Dashboard Report 2 - 2021 Sustainability Dashboard Report 3 - 2021 Sustainability Plan 2021-2025 Sustainability Plan 2020 Progress Report Q3 2020 Progress report Q2 2020 Progress report Q1 2020 We note that REPSA has made substantial progress in implementing its sustainability plan, as well as significant attempts to increase stakeholder interaction with those who lodges grievance and other parties with an interest in REPSA’s operations.

All the relevant assessments has to be conducted prior resuming their land clearing for palm planting in the future. In December 2017, through our internal monitoring, we have detected land use change at in one of their Malaysian sites in Sarawak. Samling clarified that there was no land clearing activities. To gain further insight, Wilmar conducted a site visit to check on the allegation in end March 2018. During the field assessment,we verified that there was no breach of Wilmar’s NDPE policy. Specifically, we have identified: 1. Location of area which was identified as deforestation in the NGO report is an area which is a mature planted forest of with Acacia sp. mix with Eucalyptus sp. 2. The existing Acacia sp. and Eucalyptus sp. trees were recently harvested and is currently undergoing replanting with the same two species. 3. During the visit, no sign of new oil palm development was found in the areas designated for Acacia sp. and Eucalyptus sp. tree plantation. To enable Wilmar to conduct ongoing monitoring on Samling's group wide palm operation, we have requested several documentations from Samling and will continue to follow up with Samling accordingly.

Genting also invited Wilmar and TFT to visit one of its mills and the surrounding FFB suppliers to better understand how it may be able to improve its practices. A meeting was held with Genting on 2 March 2015; both PT Citra Sawit Cemerlang (PT CSC) and PT Permata Sawit Mandiri (PT PSM) have completed the HCS studies. Genting has committed not to develop on HCS areas as recommended by their HCS assessors. Wilmar convened a meeting on 3 November 2015 between Genting Plantations Berhad (Genting Plantations), Greenomics, Aidenvironment and the Secretariat of Indonesia Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP) soon after Greenomics raised their concerns again about Genting Plantations’ alleged noncompliance with Wilmar’s Policy in their subsidiary PT Citra Sawit Cemerlang (CSC). Genting clarified that HCS assessment was conducted for PT PSM; and Land Use and Change Cover (LUCC) assessment, a vegetation cover stratification and identification of areas that could be HCS forest, for PT CSC as the HCS toolkit was not ready at that time.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Uganda also released a statement responding to the FoE report.As part of Wilmar’s No Deforestation, No Peat and No Exploitation Policy (“Policy”) commitments, we have been working with The Forest Trust (TFT), our policy implementation partner, to conduct an independent study on the level of compliance by our subsidiaries and joint ventures such as OPUL, with the Policy. To that end, TFT has conducted several field assessments since 2014 on the Kalangala site to identify gaps, conduct training and monitor the progress of closing these gaps. The field visits also included dialogues with relevant multi-stakeholders in the district, including the District Government officials, development agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), farmers, land owners to understand and address their concerns, if any, with the objective of establishing the impact of the oil palm development project on communities in Kalangala vis-à-vis allegations of unfair treatment, land conflicts and exploitation of some communities in the district. In this regard, TFT also invited the National Association of Professional Environmentalists (NAPE) and NGO representatives in Uganda to be part of this study. Together with Wilmar, TFT also conducted interviews with the list of farmers that was provided by FoE to investigate the grievance raised.In April 2015, the High Court of Uganda instructed for mediation to take place between the parties, who are; affected local community member, John Muyisa, the plaintiff of the case in question; the daughter of the original landowner Sylivia Gloria N.K Sempa; as well as Bidco Uganda and Oil Palm Uganda Limited, associate companies of Wilmar, to settle the land disputes in lieu of litigation. Wilmar was informed that only if no settlement is reached at mediation, would the case be scheduled for a formal court hearing, which eventually occurred. The court hearing was however postponed a number of times including from 19 December 2016 to 8 March 2017.In January 2017, the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) initiated an investigation on the land conflict issues upon receiving a complaint from the National Association of Professional Environmentalists (NAPE), representing a group of 38 smallholder farmers (Bugala Farmers Association) living in Kalangala, Bugala Island. CAO has officially closed the case as of March 2018. For more details, please refer to CAO’s report.Lawyers from the company and the complainants were in discussion to apply to the court for withdrawal of case during a hearing scheduled on 2 October 2018. During the hearing, the plaintiffs informed the court that the matter had been resolved and that they are willing to withdraw the case upon receiving the land titles, which were still being processed at the land office. A subsequent hearing was arranged for 5 February 2019 to close the case with an amended plaint; that is, to exclude parties who have agreed on case withdrawal as agreed upon during the mediation process. However, due to the refusal of some plaintiffs to accept the revised plaint, the case was re-adjourned for another hearing on 31 October 2019. The initial hearing date for 18 April 2019 was postponed after further changes to the complaints case by the plaintiffs. The hearing on 31 October 2019 was eventually further adjourned by the registrar of courts until 5 May 2020 as the judge went to Kampala for a conference on the same date.However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all court proceedings in Uganda were put to hold for a few months and the case has been postponed to 8 December 2020. On 8 December 2020, Wilmar was informed that the judge who was handling this case had been transferred and a new judge will look into the matter; because of this, the case was adjourned and scheduled for 6 April 2021. However, on 16 June 2021, Wilmar was informed that the case is being adjourned again, due to it being transferred to yet another judge. To enable the new judge to be better acquainted with the details of the case, the hearing has been fixed for 8 September 2021. On 8 September 2021, we have been informed that the judge who handled the matter earlier has been transferred, therefore the case was adjourned indefinitely, pending the appointment of a new judge.Hearing was resumed in March 2022 and the case was finally dismissed on 21 April 2022.",https://www.foei.org/press_releases/archive-by-subject/food-sovereignty-press/ugandan-oil-palm-conglomerate-taken-court-land-grab-claims,

We have committed to strengthen our efforts, specifically on the procedures in providing remediation to workers and address the concern of suitability of PPE for tropical country. We will continue to provide regular updates to Amnesty International on the various programmes we have put in place, including our collaboration with our peers in the Decent Rural Living Initiative and our collaboration with Verite. In February 2020, Verité conducted final verification audit to assess the condition on the ground for further improvement. The assessment covered one (1) mill and two (2) estates each from the Milano and DLI sites. A total of 56 management representatives (35 in Milano, 21 in DLI) and 130 workers (54 in Milano, 76 in DLI) from the mills and estates were interviewed. In addition, a total of 37 other stakeholders (26 in Milano, 11 in DLI) were interviewed; these stakeholders consist of clinic personnel, union officers, child care personnel, cooperative officers, gender committee officers, women’s working group staff, school teachers, smallholders, transportation suppliers, and public relations. Documents and records such as, but not limited to policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs), personnel files, pay records, time records were also reviewed. Closing meetings were held at the end of the assessment for each site, during which findings, risks, and observations were presented to and discussed with management personnel. Verite’s summary of findings from July 2020 of PT Milano and PT DLI’s three year sustainability plan is available here. In the meantime, we will continue to provide regular updates to Amnesty International on the various programmes we have put in place, including our collaboration with our peers in the Decent Rural Living Initiative and our collaboration with Verite.",,

416,Wilmar International,,Closed,9/1/2016,,,,,Mighty Earth,Korindo Group,,,,,"Prior to the publication of Mighty Earth Report - Burning Paradise in September 2016, Wilmar has already initiated engagement with Korindo Group since late 2015, following our Supplier Group Compliance Verification programme that alerted us of the allegations of noncompliance to Wilmar’s Sustainability Policy. While the supplier has committed to moratorium of land clearing after our meetings, we detected land clearing continued to happen while they were exploring options for various assessments, including HCV and HCS assessment. Wilmar has therefore put on hold purchases from Korindo Group, where our last purchase was in June 2016. On 1 August 2016, PT Tunas Sawa Erma, a subsidiary of Korindo, declared an immediate three month moratorium on new land development, while developing a comprehensive “No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation” (NDPE) policy. On 10 November 2016, PT Tunas Sawa Erma Group extended its moratorium to include PT Tunas Sawa Erma, PT Berkat Cipta Abadi, and PT Dongin Prabhawa. On 12 November 2021, TSE published its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) commitments, demonstrated its commitment aligned with NDPE Policy. As of April 2024, Korindo Group has met all the requirements stipulated in our re-entry criteria. This includes their commitment to the development of a Recovery Plan for Non-Compliant Land Clearing to the NDPE policy at group level, for activity that has taken place from January 2016 onwards. Based on the detailed review of documentation, reports and a letter of commitment from Korindo Group, the Wilmar Suspension Committee has given due consideration of this progress and lifted the suspension of Korindo Group in April 2024. Korindo/TSE Group has also published their total liability and recovery plan for 2024–2049, which indicates the locations where the recovery plan activities will take place, as well as a list of initiatives included in their recovery plan. These initiatives encompass river buffer-zone rehabilitation, enhancing biodiversity, supporting the socio-economic development of local communities and rehabilitating mangrove areas in North Maluku, among others.",http://www.mightyearth.org/BurningParadise/,

A further meeting was held with EHP on 8 July 2015 wherein EHP agreed to a moratorium on landclearing activities in PT VMA. EHP has engaged a reputable HCS assessor to conduct the HCS assessments. A few more meetings were held with EHP thereafter. The HCS assessments were completed in 2016; as a result almost 50% of PT VMA’s concession will need to be conserved. The full report has completed the HCSA peer review, and the summary report and the peer review feedback can be found here. On 27 September 2016, Wilmar received a new report from Greenpeace alleging deforestation by PT Arrtu Energie Resources (PT AER) and exploitations in PT Tandan Sawita Papua (PT TSP). Report is available here (http://www.greenpeace.nl/Global/nederland/report/2016/bossen/Deadly-Trade-off-IOI-Report.pdf) Dialogue was immediately initiated with EHP to seek clarifications on the allegations. EHP issued the following statement responding to the report: http://www.eaglehighplantations.com/media-center/news-views/161-october-2016.html A meeting was further held with EHP on 8 November 2016, where Wilmar sought further clarification on the allegations. According to EHP, the deforestation in PT AER was carried out by surrounding communities. In order to avoid similar incident from recurring, EHP has committed to conduct land tenure study. EHP is also in the process of enhancing its firefighting effort to prevent similar fire incidences from occuring in their concessions in the future. With regards to the allegations of exploitation at PT TSP, the chronology of events on the labour dispute and the shooting incident was shared by EHP. EHP was also in the process of seeking official statement from the authority to support the clarifications. A follow up meeting was held on 4 April 2019 to obtain updates on the various issues raised against PT VMA, PT AER and PT TSP. EHP clarified that that no new development has taken place in PT VMA, and presented information on its conservation project i.e. “AMOUR” (Arrtu, Mayak, Orangutan Rescue), which is located on an area of 4,000 ha within PT AER. The AMOUR project is aimed at protecting and restoring the habitats of orang utan in the PT AER’s HCV areas. Additionally, EHP has also worked to Rimba Raya and Yasiwa to develop other conservation programmes in Central Kalimantan and in East Kalimantan, respectively. On PT TSP’s case, EHP updated that third party auditors have conducted site visit between 11 to 13 January 2019 to assess and verify the allegations reported by Greenpeace. According to the findings of the audit report: (i) the palm oil development within PT TSP that took place between 2011 to 2013 was carried out in accordance to the HCV and SIA reports, and (ii) on the allegations related to labour, the audit report concluded that PT TSP complied with RSPO P&C requirements. Supporting documentation was also shared by EHP and these corroborated the clarifications provided to Wilmar.",http://www.greenomics.org/docs/IPOP_Implementation_Report-05_Greenomics.pdf,
418,Wilmar International,,Closed,8/3/2016,,,,,Link-AR Borneo,"Sintang Raya, a subsidiary of MIWON Group",,,,,"Dialogue was first initiated with PT Sintang Raya (PT SR) on 5 August 2016. On 16 September 2016, together with The Forest Trust (TFT), Wilmar convened a meeting at PT SR’s office in Pontianak, where PT SR provided the necessary supporting documents and clarified its position on the allegations. In July 2018, Wilmar carried out field investigations at PT SR with TFT and interviewed relevant stakeholders on the allegations of land conflict and criminalisation of several villagers, stemming from their protest against PT SR and the PT Cipta Tumbuh Berkembang (PT CTB) on the handling of the disputed land. It appeared that the allegation arose due to conflicting legal ownership of the land in question, between PT SR and PT CTB, which affected the communities situated in and around the concession areas. PT SR has ‘Izin Lokasi’ (location permit) and ‘Hak Guna Usaha’ (HGU) in the regent of Kubu Raya where it operates. Local authorities however issued an Izin Lokasi (location permit) to PT CTB, which overlapped with PT SR’s HGU. In 2008, members of the Olak Olak community handed over 801 ha of land to PT CTB, jointly agreeing that 80% of the land would become main estates (‘kebun inti’) and 20% would be developed under a plasma smallholder scheme. Without awareness of the aforementioned HGU issue, the land given by the community to PT CTB for oil palm development was actually within PT SR’s HGU. PT SR carried out mediation efforts with PT CTB thereafter, and in 2012 both companies jointly in an ‘Akte Perjanjian Perdamaian’ (peace agreement) agreed to resolve the land dispute amicably. This dispute concerns a total of 890.9 ha of 'kebun inti' and 151.71 ha of plasma area that was developed by PT CTB. The ‘Akte Perjanjian Perdamaian’ decreed that the plantation area developed by PT CTB within PT SR’s HGU is to be transferred to PT SR, and that PT SR will compensate PT CTB for the operational costs incurred in developing the land. As part of the 'Akte Perjanjian Perdamaian', PT CTB has also agreed to socialise this arrangement to members of the Olak Olak community. As per the agreement, the compensation is to be settled in 2 phases; whereby the first phase is for 890.9 ha, and the second phase is for 151.71 ha. PT SR compensated PT CTB accordingly for 890.9 ha; the handover of the 151.71 ha of plasma land from PT CTB to PT SR however has not been completed. On 21 August 2017, mediation facilitated by the Kubu Raya government was carried out between PT SR, PT CTB and Olak-olak community to discuss the settlement of the 151.71 ha of plasma area. PT SR and PT CTB subsequently reached a resolution to address the dispute over the contested plasma area. An updated land survey mapped out that only 103.95 ha of the plasma area was located within PT SR’s HGU, while the remaining plasma area of 47.76 ha was located outside of PT SR’s HGU (and within PT CTB’s concession). PT SR compensated PT CTB for the 103.95 ha. Both companies signed the “Akta notaris perjanjian penyelesaian dan pengoperan kerjasama” to formalize the settlement of the land dispute on 11 November 2021. After resolving the land dispute, PT SR and Koperasi Habis Gelap Terbitlah Terang (formerly Koperasi Serba Usaha, Sawit Harapan Jaya) entered into a “perjanjian kerjasama” on 24 November 2021, whereby PT ST agreed to continue managing the 103.95 ha plasma area for the Olak – olak community and to share the profits to the cooperative. Our last meeting with PT SR was in June 2022 and in October 2022, Wilmar conducted a field visit to assess the situation. There have been no further disputes by the communities.",,

In end September 2017, KLHK issued a letter stated that the police has taken over the investigation of this case involving PT APSL and Kelompok Tani Nelayan Andalan. As investigation by the government is ongoing, we respect the process and let it runs its course. In a follow up meeting with APSL in January 2018, it was confirmed PT APSL was not involved in the fire incidents.

Wilmar will re-emphasise its Policy to the suppliers, clarify the allegations; conduct field audits and assess its findings accordingly, including developing a corrective action plan to address the issues in question. Wilmar’s statement is available here.On 2 June 2016, Wilmar attended a multi-stakeholder meeting with EoF and several palm oil companies named in the report to discuss the next course of action. We understand that a task force, headed by the Indonesian government, EoF and WWF, would be established to address illegal farming and communities in the park.A further meeting was held on 28 July 2016 to continue our dialogue in June.The Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) setup a multi-stakeholder task force for Tesso Nilo Ecosystem Revitalization (Revitalisasi Ekosistem Tesso Nilo, RETN), composed of MoEF, Riau Provincial Government and NGOs including EoF members and Mitra Insani. In November 2016, Wilmar, together with other companies named in the report attended a meeting hosted by MoEF and RETN, where the companies were informed not to purchase illegal FFB coming from the Tesso Nilo National Park and its landscape. The identification of the illegal oil palm operators is the first and most crucial step in the removal of illegal FFB from the supply chain. During these meetings, Wilmar and the other companies requested for the list of companies which are considered illegal in the landscape, however this list has not been forthcoming. In support of the RETN taskforce, EoF investigated the flow of illegal FFB from TNNP in June, July and August 2017, the report, titled “Enough is enough” was released on 8 June 2018.

The small land clearance (around 20-30 Ha based on Wilmar’s internal monitoring) on the alleged concession was due to encroachment activities by local communities; activities have ceased after swift intervention by PT LIH. In August 2015, PT LIH was investigated by police in relation to forest fires associated with land clearing. PT LIH reaffirms its commitment to following the legal proceeding and prevailing laws. Wilmar conducted a joint field audit with third-party auditor on the alleged PT LIH concession to assess the allegations. The field assessment revealed that some efforts have been undertaken by PT LIH to manage the fires, including reporting the fire incidences to the authorities and conducting preliminary investigations and further provided recommendations for improvements on fire suppression and prevention. On 22 September 2015, it was reported in the media that the Indonesian authority has suspended PT LIH’s license. Wilmar halted purchases from PT LIH, pending further investigation and clarification.

PT SIL has provided necessary supporting documents and replied officially to Wilmar. A further meeting was held with PT SIL on 18 March 2015 where PT SIL committed to continuing the mediation process with local communities. Wilmar has conducted three field visits into the alleged affected areas in May, June and December 2015, respectively. Progress Update on PT SIL is available here. As a result of the above engagements with various concerned stakeholders, Wilmar agreed to actively facilitate the conflict resolution process between PT SIL and the affected communities. Wilmar has also conveyed to PT SIL that their approach of persuading the communities to surrender their land in return for compensation had caused some uneasiness amongst community members, as they felt threatened by PT SIL, even though the company did not force their requests upon them. In order to move forward with this case, the local NGO, Transformasi untuk Keadilan (TUK) Indonesia at the time agreed to share with Wilmar two crucial documents immediately after the third field visit in December 2015. Despite several reminders, to date we have not received the said documents. Without these documents, Wilmar is unable to move forward with the investigation. The documents that we required are as follows: 1. Detailed information of the 529 households, e.g.: land owner’s name, coordinates, land area, etc. 2. A letter from the Governor of Bengkulu in 2004 stating that the communities have rights to the contested land. On 14 January 2019, Mongabay reported PT SIL's involvement in criminalisation of farmers; PT SIL categorically denied the accusation. Wilmar conducted a field verification from 6 - 8 February 2019 together with a local NGO representative from the Bengkulu district. The purpose of the visit was to verify concerns surrounding allegations that PT SIL was intimidating and using criminal force when approaching villagers to acquire their land, which was within the company’s concession. During the field visit, the verification team has engaged with several key stakeholders on the ground, including PT SIL, government representatives and village heads. The local NGO representative from the verification team had also reached out to Forum Petani Bersatu (FPB), which has been assisting villagers in preventing their land from being acquired by PT SIL. FPB however declined the meeting request. The team also met with three village heads, who clarified that there has been no intimidation or use of criminal force by PT SIL on any of the villagers in the three villages. However, one villager noted that he was aware of the ongoing legal dispute between PT SIL and two people that from Kota Bengkulu; the said people were not villagers but are occupying the concession land near his village. The outcome of our field visit was shared with the author of the Mongabay article on 11 February 2019. In 2021, following completion of legal proceedings, it was decided by the authorities that PT SIL would manage the land on behalf of the aggrieved villagers. PT SIL agreed and suggested further, a compensation scheme for the villagers in the form of land swaps. In February 2021, Wilmar commissioned and funded EcoNusantara (ENS), an independent advisory and consultancy expert, to conduct field visit to assess the situation on the ground. ENS managed to engage directly with TUK Indonesia, FPB and the affected community throughout the process. A follow up visit was carried out in October 2021. According to ENS, the communities in general supported and were open to collaboration with PT SIL. PT SIL has carried out internal restructuring and have improved their approach in negotiation with communities related to land acquisition.

Evacuation was recommended by YOSL-OIC because PT Rapala’s concession is mainly shrub and does not connect directly to Leuser National Park. The small shrubby patch of 60 ha is surrounded by oil palm plantations in all corners so the area will not be a viable habitat for the pair of orangutans.
