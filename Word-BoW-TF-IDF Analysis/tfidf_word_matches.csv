workers,118,"SMALL HOLDERS AFFAIRS: The Small Holders Affairs is a Department of the NBPOL who acts as the mediator and watchdog between us the Small Holder Growers and the Company NBPOL. I acknowledge both the Department and the working Personals within the department which they have assisted us throughout the years. But one of the most disgusting thing is when there is a major dispute between the company and the small holder the Department dont hear the grievances of the Small Holder Growers and act as the mediator to bring the issue right up to the management of the company so we can discuss the issue on a round table and come to a compromise for the beneficiary of us all and the Palm Oil Industry. Instead the Department acts as a police to suspend the blocks which are under the allegation or dispute. Even some disputes and grievances applied through the grievance forms are just squeezed and thrown into the trash cans. Also most of the time the Department act as a dictator of the company to deprive the privileges and rights of the small holder grower to speak out on some unfair issues the company is practicing; they implement agendas and ideas for the interest of the Company and undermine the wellbeing and freedom expression and speech from the smallholder growers. BUFFER ZONE EXPLOITATION: THE Company, NBPOL is exploiting the 20 metre buffer zone limit, photos below shown: Kumbango Plantation beside Dagi River bank and clearing for new replant.Our mighty Dagi river has caused enormous flooding, great land mass devastation and erosion due to mass deforestations and buffer zone exploitations. The river itself has gone very tinny, when we were kids, everybody crossed this river only by swimming; but today its only ankle deep, we just walk across it. I usually live just on the other side of this river; this river is my livelihood.WASTE DISPOSAL INTO THE RIVER: Kumbango Plantation workers are dumping waste metal junks and workshop junks into our Dagi river bank. Photos shown below: Workshop waste thrown beside roadside just 20 metres away from our Dagi River Bank.BIO GAS ELECTRICITY POWER PLANT: The company has set up two (2) Bio Gas Electricity Power Plants, one at Mosa Oil Mill, and the other one at Kumbango Oil Mill. The Plants generate enormous supply of electricity which is more than enough to feed the whole province with surplus. The Plants act as the step up electricity supply to the Electricity Commission of PNG which rakes in PGK millions on a monthly basis. We the Small Holder Growers are being left out of the income revenue because the plant is also run by the waste of the FFB Palm Oil which we supply to the company. If they dont share with us the income revenue, at least the company must feed the electricity supply to our respective homes as well to be part beneficiaries of the development. Photos of the Plants are shown below: EXESSIVE DEDUCTIONS: Also the company is placing excessive deductions on our small FFB Palm Oil Income Revenue to run its operation. All our toils are being watered down just to receive a lousy PGK 170, per pay day, even though the price of the Palm Oil is very high at the World Market in US Dollars. The lousy PGK 170 is equivalent to a lousy USD50.PRICING FORMULAI kindly ask the RSPO Board of Panel to help the Small Holder Growers to liaise with the company and review the pricing formula which they are using to pay the growers. REVIEW CONTRACT AGREEMENT: The CONTRACT AGREEMENT between the company and the Smallholder Growers were set in place by the Harrisons and Crossfield and the Australian Government in the early stages of our Oil Palm Development Project in 1967. Most of the policies and agreements set in place were for the beneficiary and gain of the manipulating company under the colonial mindset for the benefits of our ruling masters. The agreement placed the Smallholder Growers in an awkward position where we have no power to do or say in what the company was doing. We are being treated as slaves to the Company, the Government and the Oil Palm Industry. Even though our positive economic input are constant to the economic development of the country and the world as a whole, by supplying a steady tonnage of FFB Palm Oil to the company on a weekly basis. I sincerely urge the RSPO Board to assist us in reviewing the CONTRACT AGREEMENT on a roundtable with the Company and the Hoskins Oil Palm Growers Association (OPGA). The agreement must be satisfactory to both parties under RSPO Protocols and Humanitarian wellbeing.GENERAL HUMANITARIAN WELFARE AND SUSTAINABILITYThis is the forty eight (48) year of the Hoskins Oil Palm Project since 1967. The project have trained us to be good Palm Oil Growers adhering to the Protocols and Principles of the Palm Oil Industry through these prolonged period of time. In those early days when the RSPO Board was not set in place yet, we were taught the general practice and principles on palm oil through the DPI, about how to maintain the cleanliness of our oil palm blocks, homes, drinking water, to have in our custody the land title form, pay rental fees, maintaining boundary pegs, maintaining 100 metres buffer zone, how to apply fertilizers like ammonium phosphate and ammonium nitrite, process of harvesting and upkeeping, selective weeding, how to use chemicals and tools, policies against trespassing unnecessarily to other blocks without given consent from the owner, and maintaining a friendly and peaceful environment. In doing all those things we thought that in return we will receive a higher income to enhance and stabilize our living standards to a modernize standard. But all those hard labor work were all in vain. The price of the FFB Palm Oil is still on its lowest rates since we started in 1967, and even it went down to zero rates some years back. The cost of living are very high, with accumulating prices of goods and services, government GST taxes on every goods and services, high school fees demand, accumulating and extended families living in a single oil palm block. The Palm Oil FFB price and the pay we are receiving cannot sustain all these accumulating necessities of life. To tell the truth, right now we are surviving through subsistence gardening on little bits of reserve land we have. Otherwise weve all been dead. If we preach and talk about RSPO, the commodity we are dealing and working with must be sustainable enough to meet the standards and demands of every parties involved. We the primary producer of the commodity must be sustained and you the end user must be sustained and satisfied. We even cannot do savings to start up some other spinoff businesses. Throughout all these years we toil to nothing. Most of us have to search for optional means and ways for sustainable income to start up other profitable businesses. We live in run down homes with no proper water sanitation, no electricity, no proper health care, no life insurance cover, no proper working machineries. We even cant employ laborers to help us manage some of the work load due to financial incapabilities. All heavy jobs are done manually just by using our own strength. All our pioneering fathers have died young from all sorts of body conditions like; back problems, knee problems, eye problems, heart and kidney failures and many undiagnosed ailments because of high body strain levels with no stabilize diets. Even many of the growers were killed by falling FFBs and palm branches while in the process of harvesting. Others were killed by falling oil palm stumps which have been poisoned, while unknowingly working under them. There was no compensation for all those looses of lives. If we talk RSPO lets all come together on a round table and discuss all these underlying issues for the beneficiary and sustainability of us all under the RSPO concept."

land,118,"SMALL HOLDERS AFFAIRS: The Small Holders Affairs is a Department of the NBPOL who acts as the mediator and watchdog between us the Small Holder Growers and the Company NBPOL. I acknowledge both the Department and the working Personals within the department which they have assisted us throughout the years. But one of the most disgusting thing is when there is a major dispute between the company and the small holder the Department dont hear the grievances of the Small Holder Growers and act as the mediator to bring the issue right up to the management of the company so we can discuss the issue on a round table and come to a compromise for the beneficiary of us all and the Palm Oil Industry. Instead the Department acts as a police to suspend the blocks which are under the allegation or dispute. Even some disputes and grievances applied through the grievance forms are just squeezed and thrown into the trash cans. Also most of the time the Department act as a dictator of the company to deprive the privileges and rights of the small holder grower to speak out on some unfair issues the company is practicing; they implement agendas and ideas for the interest of the Company and undermine the wellbeing and freedom expression and speech from the smallholder growers. BUFFER ZONE EXPLOITATION: THE Company, NBPOL is exploiting the 20 metre buffer zone limit, photos below shown: Kumbango Plantation beside Dagi River bank and clearing for new replant.Our mighty Dagi river has caused enormous flooding, great land mass devastation and erosion due to mass deforestations and buffer zone exploitations. The river itself has gone very tinny, when we were kids, everybody crossed this river only by swimming; but today its only ankle deep, we just walk across it. I usually live just on the other side of this river; this river is my livelihood.WASTE DISPOSAL INTO THE RIVER: Kumbango Plantation workers are dumping waste metal junks and workshop junks into our Dagi river bank. Photos shown below: Workshop waste thrown beside roadside just 20 metres away from our Dagi River Bank.BIO GAS ELECTRICITY POWER PLANT: The company has set up two (2) Bio Gas Electricity Power Plants, one at Mosa Oil Mill, and the other one at Kumbango Oil Mill. The Plants generate enormous supply of electricity which is more than enough to feed the whole province with surplus. The Plants act as the step up electricity supply to the Electricity Commission of PNG which rakes in PGK millions on a monthly basis. We the Small Holder Growers are being left out of the income revenue because the plant is also run by the waste of the FFB Palm Oil which we supply to the company. If they dont share with us the income revenue, at least the company must feed the electricity supply to our respective homes as well to be part beneficiaries of the development. Photos of the Plants are shown below: EXESSIVE DEDUCTIONS: Also the company is placing excessive deductions on our small FFB Palm Oil Income Revenue to run its operation. All our toils are being watered down just to receive a lousy PGK 170, per pay day, even though the price of the Palm Oil is very high at the World Market in US Dollars. The lousy PGK 170 is equivalent to a lousy USD50.PRICING FORMULAI kindly ask the RSPO Board of Panel to help the Small Holder Growers to liaise with the company and review the pricing formula which they are using to pay the growers. REVIEW CONTRACT AGREEMENT: The CONTRACT AGREEMENT between the company and the Smallholder Growers were set in place by the Harrisons and Crossfield and the Australian Government in the early stages of our Oil Palm Development Project in 1967. Most of the policies and agreements set in place were for the beneficiary and gain of the manipulating company under the colonial mindset for the benefits of our ruling masters. The agreement placed the Smallholder Growers in an awkward position where we have no power to do or say in what the company was doing. We are being treated as slaves to the Company, the Government and the Oil Palm Industry. Even though our positive economic input are constant to the economic development of the country and the world as a whole, by supplying a steady tonnage of FFB Palm Oil to the company on a weekly basis. I sincerely urge the RSPO Board to assist us in reviewing the CONTRACT AGREEMENT on a roundtable with the Company and the Hoskins Oil Palm Growers Association (OPGA). The agreement must be satisfactory to both parties under RSPO Protocols and Humanitarian wellbeing.GENERAL HUMANITARIAN WELFARE AND SUSTAINABILITYThis is the forty eight (48) year of the Hoskins Oil Palm Project since 1967. The project have trained us to be good Palm Oil Growers adhering to the Protocols and Principles of the Palm Oil Industry through these prolonged period of time. In those early days when the RSPO Board was not set in place yet, we were taught the general practice and principles on palm oil through the DPI, about how to maintain the cleanliness of our oil palm blocks, homes, drinking water, to have in our custody the land title form, pay rental fees, maintaining boundary pegs, maintaining 100 metres buffer zone, how to apply fertilizers like ammonium phosphate and ammonium nitrite, process of harvesting and upkeeping, selective weeding, how to use chemicals and tools, policies against trespassing unnecessarily to other blocks without given consent from the owner, and maintaining a friendly and peaceful environment. In doing all those things we thought that in return we will receive a higher income to enhance and stabilize our living standards to a modernize standard. But all those hard labor work were all in vain. The price of the FFB Palm Oil is still on its lowest rates since we started in 1967, and even it went down to zero rates some years back. The cost of living are very high, with accumulating prices of goods and services, government GST taxes on every goods and services, high school fees demand, accumulating and extended families living in a single oil palm block. The Palm Oil FFB price and the pay we are receiving cannot sustain all these accumulating necessities of life. To tell the truth, right now we are surviving through subsistence gardening on little bits of reserve land we have. Otherwise weve all been dead. If we preach and talk about RSPO, the commodity we are dealing and working with must be sustainable enough to meet the standards and demands of every parties involved. We the primary producer of the commodity must be sustained and you the end user must be sustained and satisfied. We even cannot do savings to start up some other spinoff businesses. Throughout all these years we toil to nothing. Most of us have to search for optional means and ways for sustainable income to start up other profitable businesses. We live in run down homes with no proper water sanitation, no electricity, no proper health care, no life insurance cover, no proper working machineries. We even cant employ laborers to help us manage some of the work load due to financial incapabilities. All heavy jobs are done manually just by using our own strength. All our pioneering fathers have died young from all sorts of body conditions like; back problems, knee problems, eye problems, heart and kidney failures and many undiagnosed ailments because of high body strain levels with no stabilize diets. Even many of the growers were killed by falling FFBs and palm branches while in the process of harvesting. Others were killed by falling oil palm stumps which have been poisoned, while unknowingly working under them. There was no compensation for all those looses of lives. If we talk RSPO lets all come together on a round table and discuss all these underlying issues for the beneficiary and sustainability of us all under the RSPO concept."

It was further stated that the removal of the 'discretionary bonus' and replacement of it by""Bono Solidario"" and ""RSPO Bono"" was not done transparently and they do not address the situation on the purchase price of the FFB."
company,114,"The company concerned has been clearing community lands and destroying natural forests without any reference to RSPO standards. Aerial imagery and official government reports shows that over 5200 hectares of mostly primary forest has been felled since January 20132. Fire is being used to burn cleared timber and other vegetation. Valuable timber resources have also being sold. Community testimony reveals that the company acquired rights to the respective area without any process of engagement or FPIC with the community. Furthermore, the company has been clearing extensive areas of forest without any engagement with the local communities, laying waste to large areas of forest which the communities use for hunting, fishing and gathering and as a source of medicinal plants and materials for construction, killing local wildlife and destroying their vital habitats. The area in question has been historically occupied by residents and their fore parents and includes the locations of numerous former settlements and farms that have since been left to become fallow. The operations have also extracted large volumes of important construction material from the river Aguaytia outside of the lands claimed by Plantaciones de Pucallpa and in the process used and degraded private tracks made by the community and exhausted the resources that the community depends on for their own constructions. The operations have resulted in the destruction of at least one house owned by a community member and have blocking and despoiled the creeks and rivers which the community relies on for their fishing, bathing and drinking waters. Moreover, company personnel restrict access of community members to the area for hunting, fishing and gathering and other subsistence activities. Community testimony highlights that waste materials are being dumped into the water system and all the main streams in the affected lands are no longer fit for drinking and fishing. These include the rivers Sanuya, Sheringal and Churral amongst others. Official investigations conducted by the Ministry of Agriculturehave determined that Plantaciones de Pucallpa has failed to secure the relevant permits required for forest clearance or to conduct the relevant social and environmental impact assessments. The Ministry has consequently ordered the suspension of the operations. In addition, the community understands that the company hired large numbers of people specifically to occupy the area during the field investigations by local authorities in an attempt to deliberately frustrate these visits. This has resulted in an extremely tense and conflictenvironment in which government representatives have even been threatened by company representatives. The extent of social and environmental devastation caused by these operations and the irregularities in permitting has meant these palm oil developments have become a major national controversy, as can be seen on:Despite the suspension order, the community affirms that the company has been promoting the incursion and invasion of third parties in forested areas in areas adjacent to the area cleared by Plantaciones de Pucallpa with the objective of subsequently acquiring these areas. This has resulted in the national indigenous peoples organisation (AIDESEP) to call for the suspension of all oil palm operations in Peru until contradictions and loopholes in the legal framework are resolvedand for the Congressional Commission of the Amazon and Ecology to establish a high level national taskforce to address the issue of large scale agribusiness and social conflict. Although we in the community have been made aware that the company in question is part of a wider network of companies in Peru known locally as los Malaios (the Malays), which are apparently owned by the same proprietors, it was only recently that we established that it was Plantaciones de Pucallpa that was operating in community lands. It has not been possible to identify the full ownership structure of the company and the exact nature of its links to Malaysian companies as many of these companies are registered in offshore tax havens which require limited disclosure of company information. Nevertheless, as a result of the companys own declarations to the RSPOas well as NGO investigationsit appears that these companies are connected to Asian Plantations which in 2014 was bought by FELDA Global Ventures, a founder member of the RSPO. Having now reviewed, the standards which Plantaciones de Pucallpa should be observing as an RSPO member we note the following serious violations.  New Planting Procedure: The company has conducted their operations without filing any prior notifications with the RSPO, large swathes of primary forest have been cleared and no prior HCV or SEIA assessments have been conducted.  Principle 1. Information about the companys plans and operations have never been shared with the community.  Principle 2. The company has acquired lands customarily owned and used by the community of Santa Clara de Uchunya without their free, prior and informed consent.  Principle 3. The company has not provided mechanisms to resolve any of the problems being caused. The company has failed to comply with national laws prohibiting the conversion of primary forest for agricultural purposes, conversion of forest without the corresponding soil studies, environmental permits or relevant environmental and social impact assessments. The company has violated the property rights of indigenous peoples to their customary lands, their right to the natural resources that guarantee their subsistence, their right to processes of prior consultation and consent, their right to determine their own development paths in addition to many other fundamental rights of indigenous peoples which are obligatory in Peru. 9.  Principle 4. Company operations have destroyed and diverted water courses as well as blocked community access to vital water supplies for fishing and drinking.  Principle 5. No EIA or HCV assessments have been carried out to ensure the protection of the environment, wildlife and the social values of natural ecosystems and mitigate damage. Lands are being cleared with the use of fire.  Principle 6. No participatory SIAs have been carried out. There has been no proper consultation with Santa Clara de Uchunya. Dispute resolution mechanisms are absent. Customary rights have been ignored.  Principle 7. New plantings are being established without ESIAs and HCV assessments, without recognising customary rights and without the communities and indigenous peoples free, prior and informed consent. We here only note the most obvious violations. A more detailed perusal of the RSPO Principles and Criteria shows that there have been multiple violations of many of the Criteria and Indicators associated with the Principles noted above. All these violations of applicable laws are detailed in the Ministry of Agriculture official report referred to in footnote 2 and 3. These obligations flow from ILO Convention 169 and the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of human rights the provisions of which constitute binding obligations for Peru."

company,118,"SMALL HOLDERS AFFAIRS: The Small Holders Affairs is a Department of the NBPOL who acts as the mediator and watchdog between us the Small Holder Growers and the Company NBPOL. I acknowledge both the Department and the working Personals within the department which they have assisted us throughout the years. But one of the most disgusting thing is when there is a major dispute between the company and the small holder the Department dont hear the grievances of the Small Holder Growers and act as the mediator to bring the issue right up to the management of the company so we can discuss the issue on a round table and come to a compromise for the beneficiary of us all and the Palm Oil Industry. Instead the Department acts as a police to suspend the blocks which are under the allegation or dispute. Even some disputes and grievances applied through the grievance forms are just squeezed and thrown into the trash cans. Also most of the time the Department act as a dictator of the company to deprive the privileges and rights of the small holder grower to speak out on some unfair issues the company is practicing; they implement agendas and ideas for the interest of the Company and undermine the wellbeing and freedom expression and speech from the smallholder growers. BUFFER ZONE EXPLOITATION: THE Company, NBPOL is exploiting the 20 metre buffer zone limit, photos below shown: Kumbango Plantation beside Dagi River bank and clearing for new replant.Our mighty Dagi river has caused enormous flooding, great land mass devastation and erosion due to mass deforestations and buffer zone exploitations. The river itself has gone very tinny, when we were kids, everybody crossed this river only by swimming; but today its only ankle deep, we just walk across it. I usually live just on the other side of this river; this river is my livelihood.WASTE DISPOSAL INTO THE RIVER: Kumbango Plantation workers are dumping waste metal junks and workshop junks into our Dagi river bank. Photos shown below: Workshop waste thrown beside roadside just 20 metres away from our Dagi River Bank.BIO GAS ELECTRICITY POWER PLANT: The company has set up two (2) Bio Gas Electricity Power Plants, one at Mosa Oil Mill, and the other one at Kumbango Oil Mill. The Plants generate enormous supply of electricity which is more than enough to feed the whole province with surplus. The Plants act as the step up electricity supply to the Electricity Commission of PNG which rakes in PGK millions on a monthly basis. We the Small Holder Growers are being left out of the income revenue because the plant is also run by the waste of the FFB Palm Oil which we supply to the company. If they dont share with us the income revenue, at least the company must feed the electricity supply to our respective homes as well to be part beneficiaries of the development. Photos of the Plants are shown below: EXESSIVE DEDUCTIONS: Also the company is placing excessive deductions on our small FFB Palm Oil Income Revenue to run its operation. All our toils are being watered down just to receive a lousy PGK 170, per pay day, even though the price of the Palm Oil is very high at the World Market in US Dollars. The lousy PGK 170 is equivalent to a lousy USD50.PRICING FORMULAI kindly ask the RSPO Board of Panel to help the Small Holder Growers to liaise with the company and review the pricing formula which they are using to pay the growers. REVIEW CONTRACT AGREEMENT: The CONTRACT AGREEMENT between the company and the Smallholder Growers were set in place by the Harrisons and Crossfield and the Australian Government in the early stages of our Oil Palm Development Project in 1967. Most of the policies and agreements set in place were for the beneficiary and gain of the manipulating company under the colonial mindset for the benefits of our ruling masters. The agreement placed the Smallholder Growers in an awkward position where we have no power to do or say in what the company was doing. We are being treated as slaves to the Company, the Government and the Oil Palm Industry. Even though our positive economic input are constant to the economic development of the country and the world as a whole, by supplying a steady tonnage of FFB Palm Oil to the company on a weekly basis. I sincerely urge the RSPO Board to assist us in reviewing the CONTRACT AGREEMENT on a roundtable with the Company and the Hoskins Oil Palm Growers Association (OPGA). The agreement must be satisfactory to both parties under RSPO Protocols and Humanitarian wellbeing.GENERAL HUMANITARIAN WELFARE AND SUSTAINABILITYThis is the forty eight (48) year of the Hoskins Oil Palm Project since 1967. The project have trained us to be good Palm Oil Growers adhering to the Protocols and Principles of the Palm Oil Industry through these prolonged period of time. In those early days when the RSPO Board was not set in place yet, we were taught the general practice and principles on palm oil through the DPI, about how to maintain the cleanliness of our oil palm blocks, homes, drinking water, to have in our custody the land title form, pay rental fees, maintaining boundary pegs, maintaining 100 metres buffer zone, how to apply fertilizers like ammonium phosphate and ammonium nitrite, process of harvesting and upkeeping, selective weeding, how to use chemicals and tools, policies against trespassing unnecessarily to other blocks without given consent from the owner, and maintaining a friendly and peaceful environment. In doing all those things we thought that in return we will receive a higher income to enhance and stabilize our living standards to a modernize standard. But all those hard labor work were all in vain. The price of the FFB Palm Oil is still on its lowest rates since we started in 1967, and even it went down to zero rates some years back. The cost of living are very high, with accumulating prices of goods and services, government GST taxes on every goods and services, high school fees demand, accumulating and extended families living in a single oil palm block. The Palm Oil FFB price and the pay we are receiving cannot sustain all these accumulating necessities of life. To tell the truth, right now we are surviving through subsistence gardening on little bits of reserve land we have. Otherwise weve all been dead. If we preach and talk about RSPO, the commodity we are dealing and working with must be sustainable enough to meet the standards and demands of every parties involved. We the primary producer of the commodity must be sustained and you the end user must be sustained and satisfied. We even cannot do savings to start up some other spinoff businesses. Throughout all these years we toil to nothing. Most of us have to search for optional means and ways for sustainable income to start up other profitable businesses. We live in run down homes with no proper water sanitation, no electricity, no proper health care, no life insurance cover, no proper working machineries. We even cant employ laborers to help us manage some of the work load due to financial incapabilities. All heavy jobs are done manually just by using our own strength. All our pioneering fathers have died young from all sorts of body conditions like; back problems, knee problems, eye problems, heart and kidney failures and many undiagnosed ailments because of high body strain levels with no stabilize diets. Even many of the growers were killed by falling FFBs and palm branches while in the process of harvesting. Others were killed by falling oil palm stumps which have been poisoned, while unknowingly working under them. There was no compensation for all those looses of lives. If we talk RSPO lets all come together on a round table and discuss all these underlying issues for the beneficiary and sustainability of us all under the RSPO concept."

(2) How is it that GPB has been active in the development of the MSPO standards while not striving to achieve RSPO certification standards?  (3) Why does GPB plan to start the certification process in Malaysia more than 10 years after joining RSPO?

(http://www.gentingplantations.com/report/ar12/index.htm). However, the RSPO has not received any NPP notification request from Genting during this period."
report,114,"The company concerned has been clearing community lands and destroying natural forests without any reference to RSPO standards. Aerial imagery and official government reports shows that over 5200 hectares of mostly primary forest has been felled since January 20132. Fire is being used to burn cleared timber and other vegetation. Valuable timber resources have also being sold. Community testimony reveals that the company acquired rights to the respective area without any process of engagement or FPIC with the community. Furthermore, the company has been clearing extensive areas of forest without any engagement with the local communities, laying waste to large areas of forest which the communities use for hunting, fishing and gathering and as a source of medicinal plants and materials for construction, killing local wildlife and destroying their vital habitats. The area in question has been historically occupied by residents and their fore parents and includes the locations of numerous former settlements and farms that have since been left to become fallow. The operations have also extracted large volumes of important construction material from the river Aguaytia outside of the lands claimed by Plantaciones de Pucallpa and in the process used and degraded private tracks made by the community and exhausted the resources that the community depends on for their own constructions. The operations have resulted in the destruction of at least one house owned by a community member and have blocking and despoiled the creeks and rivers which the community relies on for their fishing, bathing and drinking waters. Moreover, company personnel restrict access of community members to the area for hunting, fishing and gathering and other subsistence activities. Community testimony highlights that waste materials are being dumped into the water system and all the main streams in the affected lands are no longer fit for drinking and fishing. These include the rivers Sanuya, Sheringal and Churral amongst others. Official investigations conducted by the Ministry of Agriculturehave determined that Plantaciones de Pucallpa has failed to secure the relevant permits required for forest clearance or to conduct the relevant social and environmental impact assessments. The Ministry has consequently ordered the suspension of the operations. In addition, the community understands that the company hired large numbers of people specifically to occupy the area during the field investigations by local authorities in an attempt to deliberately frustrate these visits. This has resulted in an extremely tense and conflictenvironment in which government representatives have even been threatened by company representatives. The extent of social and environmental devastation caused by these operations and the irregularities in permitting has meant these palm oil developments have become a major national controversy, as can be seen on:Despite the suspension order, the community affirms that the company has been promoting the incursion and invasion of third parties in forested areas in areas adjacent to the area cleared by Plantaciones de Pucallpa with the objective of subsequently acquiring these areas. This has resulted in the national indigenous peoples organisation (AIDESEP) to call for the suspension of all oil palm operations in Peru until contradictions and loopholes in the legal framework are resolvedand for the Congressional Commission of the Amazon and Ecology to establish a high level national taskforce to address the issue of large scale agribusiness and social conflict. Although we in the community have been made aware that the company in question is part of a wider network of companies in Peru known locally as los Malaios (the Malays), which are apparently owned by the same proprietors, it was only recently that we established that it was Plantaciones de Pucallpa that was operating in community lands. It has not been possible to identify the full ownership structure of the company and the exact nature of its links to Malaysian companies as many of these companies are registered in offshore tax havens which require limited disclosure of company information. Nevertheless, as a result of the companys own declarations to the RSPOas well as NGO investigationsit appears that these companies are connected to Asian Plantations which in 2014 was bought by FELDA Global Ventures, a founder member of the RSPO. Having now reviewed, the standards which Plantaciones de Pucallpa should be observing as an RSPO member we note the following serious violations.  New Planting Procedure: The company has conducted their operations without filing any prior notifications with the RSPO, large swathes of primary forest have been cleared and no prior HCV or SEIA assessments have been conducted.  Principle 1. Information about the companys plans and operations have never been shared with the community.  Principle 2. The company has acquired lands customarily owned and used by the community of Santa Clara de Uchunya without their free, prior and informed consent.  Principle 3. The company has not provided mechanisms to resolve any of the problems being caused. The company has failed to comply with national laws prohibiting the conversion of primary forest for agricultural purposes, conversion of forest without the corresponding soil studies, environmental permits or relevant environmental and social impact assessments. The company has violated the property rights of indigenous peoples to their customary lands, their right to the natural resources that guarantee their subsistence, their right to processes of prior consultation and consent, their right to determine their own development paths in addition to many other fundamental rights of indigenous peoples which are obligatory in Peru. 9.  Principle 4. Company operations have destroyed and diverted water courses as well as blocked community access to vital water supplies for fishing and drinking.  Principle 5. No EIA or HCV assessments have been carried out to ensure the protection of the environment, wildlife and the social values of natural ecosystems and mitigate damage. Lands are being cleared with the use of fire.  Principle 6. No participatory SIAs have been carried out. There has been no proper consultation with Santa Clara de Uchunya. Dispute resolution mechanisms are absent. Customary rights have been ignored.  Principle 7. New plantings are being established without ESIAs and HCV assessments, without recognising customary rights and without the communities and indigenous peoples free, prior and informed consent. We here only note the most obvious violations. A more detailed perusal of the RSPO Principles and Criteria shows that there have been multiple violations of many of the Criteria and Indicators associated with the Principles noted above. All these violations of applicable laws are detailed in the Ministry of Agriculture official report referred to in footnote 2 and 3. These obligations flow from ILO Convention 169 and the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of human rights the provisions of which constitute binding obligations for Peru."

community,114,"The company concerned has been clearing community lands and destroying natural forests without any reference to RSPO standards. Aerial imagery and official government reports shows that over 5200 hectares of mostly primary forest has been felled since January 20132. Fire is being used to burn cleared timber and other vegetation. Valuable timber resources have also being sold. Community testimony reveals that the company acquired rights to the respective area without any process of engagement or FPIC with the community. Furthermore, the company has been clearing extensive areas of forest without any engagement with the local communities, laying waste to large areas of forest which the communities use for hunting, fishing and gathering and as a source of medicinal plants and materials for construction, killing local wildlife and destroying their vital habitats. The area in question has been historically occupied by residents and their fore parents and includes the locations of numerous former settlements and farms that have since been left to become fallow. The operations have also extracted large volumes of important construction material from the river Aguaytia outside of the lands claimed by Plantaciones de Pucallpa and in the process used and degraded private tracks made by the community and exhausted the resources that the community depends on for their own constructions. The operations have resulted in the destruction of at least one house owned by a community member and have blocking and despoiled the creeks and rivers which the community relies on for their fishing, bathing and drinking waters. Moreover, company personnel restrict access of community members to the area for hunting, fishing and gathering and other subsistence activities. Community testimony highlights that waste materials are being dumped into the water system and all the main streams in the affected lands are no longer fit for drinking and fishing. These include the rivers Sanuya, Sheringal and Churral amongst others. Official investigations conducted by the Ministry of Agriculturehave determined that Plantaciones de Pucallpa has failed to secure the relevant permits required for forest clearance or to conduct the relevant social and environmental impact assessments. The Ministry has consequently ordered the suspension of the operations. In addition, the community understands that the company hired large numbers of people specifically to occupy the area during the field investigations by local authorities in an attempt to deliberately frustrate these visits. This has resulted in an extremely tense and conflictenvironment in which government representatives have even been threatened by company representatives. The extent of social and environmental devastation caused by these operations and the irregularities in permitting has meant these palm oil developments have become a major national controversy, as can be seen on:Despite the suspension order, the community affirms that the company has been promoting the incursion and invasion of third parties in forested areas in areas adjacent to the area cleared by Plantaciones de Pucallpa with the objective of subsequently acquiring these areas. This has resulted in the national indigenous peoples organisation (AIDESEP) to call for the suspension of all oil palm operations in Peru until contradictions and loopholes in the legal framework are resolvedand for the Congressional Commission of the Amazon and Ecology to establish a high level national taskforce to address the issue of large scale agribusiness and social conflict. Although we in the community have been made aware that the company in question is part of a wider network of companies in Peru known locally as los Malaios (the Malays), which are apparently owned by the same proprietors, it was only recently that we established that it was Plantaciones de Pucallpa that was operating in community lands. It has not been possible to identify the full ownership structure of the company and the exact nature of its links to Malaysian companies as many of these companies are registered in offshore tax havens which require limited disclosure of company information. Nevertheless, as a result of the companys own declarations to the RSPOas well as NGO investigationsit appears that these companies are connected to Asian Plantations which in 2014 was bought by FELDA Global Ventures, a founder member of the RSPO. Having now reviewed, the standards which Plantaciones de Pucallpa should be observing as an RSPO member we note the following serious violations.  New Planting Procedure: The company has conducted their operations without filing any prior notifications with the RSPO, large swathes of primary forest have been cleared and no prior HCV or SEIA assessments have been conducted.  Principle 1. Information about the companys plans and operations have never been shared with the community.  Principle 2. The company has acquired lands customarily owned and used by the community of Santa Clara de Uchunya without their free, prior and informed consent.  Principle 3. The company has not provided mechanisms to resolve any of the problems being caused. The company has failed to comply with national laws prohibiting the conversion of primary forest for agricultural purposes, conversion of forest without the corresponding soil studies, environmental permits or relevant environmental and social impact assessments. The company has violated the property rights of indigenous peoples to their customary lands, their right to the natural resources that guarantee their subsistence, their right to processes of prior consultation and consent, their right to determine their own development paths in addition to many other fundamental rights of indigenous peoples which are obligatory in Peru. 9.  Principle 4. Company operations have destroyed and diverted water courses as well as blocked community access to vital water supplies for fishing and drinking.  Principle 5. No EIA or HCV assessments have been carried out to ensure the protection of the environment, wildlife and the social values of natural ecosystems and mitigate damage. Lands are being cleared with the use of fire.  Principle 6. No participatory SIAs have been carried out. There has been no proper consultation with Santa Clara de Uchunya. Dispute resolution mechanisms are absent. Customary rights have been ignored.  Principle 7. New plantings are being established without ESIAs and HCV assessments, without recognising customary rights and without the communities and indigenous peoples free, prior and informed consent. We here only note the most obvious violations. A more detailed perusal of the RSPO Principles and Criteria shows that there have been multiple violations of many of the Criteria and Indicators associated with the Principles noted above. All these violations of applicable laws are detailed in the Ministry of Agriculture official report referred to in footnote 2 and 3. These obligations flow from ILO Convention 169 and the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of human rights the provisions of which constitute binding obligations for Peru."

rspo,114,"The company concerned has been clearing community lands and destroying natural forests without any reference to RSPO standards. Aerial imagery and official government reports shows that over 5200 hectares of mostly primary forest has been felled since January 20132. Fire is being used to burn cleared timber and other vegetation. Valuable timber resources have also being sold. Community testimony reveals that the company acquired rights to the respective area without any process of engagement or FPIC with the community. Furthermore, the company has been clearing extensive areas of forest without any engagement with the local communities, laying waste to large areas of forest which the communities use for hunting, fishing and gathering and as a source of medicinal plants and materials for construction, killing local wildlife and destroying their vital habitats. The area in question has been historically occupied by residents and their fore parents and includes the locations of numerous former settlements and farms that have since been left to become fallow. The operations have also extracted large volumes of important construction material from the river Aguaytia outside of the lands claimed by Plantaciones de Pucallpa and in the process used and degraded private tracks made by the community and exhausted the resources that the community depends on for their own constructions. The operations have resulted in the destruction of at least one house owned by a community member and have blocking and despoiled the creeks and rivers which the community relies on for their fishing, bathing and drinking waters. Moreover, company personnel restrict access of community members to the area for hunting, fishing and gathering and other subsistence activities. Community testimony highlights that waste materials are being dumped into the water system and all the main streams in the affected lands are no longer fit for drinking and fishing. These include the rivers Sanuya, Sheringal and Churral amongst others. Official investigations conducted by the Ministry of Agriculturehave determined that Plantaciones de Pucallpa has failed to secure the relevant permits required for forest clearance or to conduct the relevant social and environmental impact assessments. The Ministry has consequently ordered the suspension of the operations. In addition, the community understands that the company hired large numbers of people specifically to occupy the area during the field investigations by local authorities in an attempt to deliberately frustrate these visits. This has resulted in an extremely tense and conflictenvironment in which government representatives have even been threatened by company representatives. The extent of social and environmental devastation caused by these operations and the irregularities in permitting has meant these palm oil developments have become a major national controversy, as can be seen on:Despite the suspension order, the community affirms that the company has been promoting the incursion and invasion of third parties in forested areas in areas adjacent to the area cleared by Plantaciones de Pucallpa with the objective of subsequently acquiring these areas. This has resulted in the national indigenous peoples organisation (AIDESEP) to call for the suspension of all oil palm operations in Peru until contradictions and loopholes in the legal framework are resolvedand for the Congressional Commission of the Amazon and Ecology to establish a high level national taskforce to address the issue of large scale agribusiness and social conflict. Although we in the community have been made aware that the company in question is part of a wider network of companies in Peru known locally as los Malaios (the Malays), which are apparently owned by the same proprietors, it was only recently that we established that it was Plantaciones de Pucallpa that was operating in community lands. It has not been possible to identify the full ownership structure of the company and the exact nature of its links to Malaysian companies as many of these companies are registered in offshore tax havens which require limited disclosure of company information. Nevertheless, as a result of the companys own declarations to the RSPOas well as NGO investigationsit appears that these companies are connected to Asian Plantations which in 2014 was bought by FELDA Global Ventures, a founder member of the RSPO. Having now reviewed, the standards which Plantaciones de Pucallpa should be observing as an RSPO member we note the following serious violations.  New Planting Procedure: The company has conducted their operations without filing any prior notifications with the RSPO, large swathes of primary forest have been cleared and no prior HCV or SEIA assessments have been conducted.  Principle 1. Information about the companys plans and operations have never been shared with the community.  Principle 2. The company has acquired lands customarily owned and used by the community of Santa Clara de Uchunya without their free, prior and informed consent.  Principle 3. The company has not provided mechanisms to resolve any of the problems being caused. The company has failed to comply with national laws prohibiting the conversion of primary forest for agricultural purposes, conversion of forest without the corresponding soil studies, environmental permits or relevant environmental and social impact assessments. The company has violated the property rights of indigenous peoples to their customary lands, their right to the natural resources that guarantee their subsistence, their right to processes of prior consultation and consent, their right to determine their own development paths in addition to many other fundamental rights of indigenous peoples which are obligatory in Peru. 9.  Principle 4. Company operations have destroyed and diverted water courses as well as blocked community access to vital water supplies for fishing and drinking.  Principle 5. No EIA or HCV assessments have been carried out to ensure the protection of the environment, wildlife and the social values of natural ecosystems and mitigate damage. Lands are being cleared with the use of fire.  Principle 6. No participatory SIAs have been carried out. There has been no proper consultation with Santa Clara de Uchunya. Dispute resolution mechanisms are absent. Customary rights have been ignored.  Principle 7. New plantings are being established without ESIAs and HCV assessments, without recognising customary rights and without the communities and indigenous peoples free, prior and informed consent. We here only note the most obvious violations. A more detailed perusal of the RSPO Principles and Criteria shows that there have been multiple violations of many of the Criteria and Indicators associated with the Principles noted above. All these violations of applicable laws are detailed in the Ministry of Agriculture official report referred to in footnote 2 and 3. These obligations flow from ILO Convention 169 and the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of human rights the provisions of which constitute binding obligations for Peru."

In 2012, Genting Plantations announced its intention to only bring its operations into full compliance with the RSPO standard by 2025 (see RSPO website). A time bound plan that suggests tactics of delay rather than real commitment to implementing the RSPO standard. They contend that Genting Plantations subsidiary, Tanjung Bahagia Sdn Bhd, is in multiple violation of the RSPOs Principles and Criteria, by failing to address the communitys concerns on land acquisition, pollution, conservation of HCV areas, open & transparent communication and consultation, and not having a dispute resolution mechanism to resolve the issues complained.

rspo,118,"SMALL HOLDERS AFFAIRS: The Small Holders Affairs is a Department of the NBPOL who acts as the mediator and watchdog between us the Small Holder Growers and the Company NBPOL. I acknowledge both the Department and the working Personals within the department which they have assisted us throughout the years. But one of the most disgusting thing is when there is a major dispute between the company and the small holder the Department dont hear the grievances of the Small Holder Growers and act as the mediator to bring the issue right up to the management of the company so we can discuss the issue on a round table and come to a compromise for the beneficiary of us all and the Palm Oil Industry. Instead the Department acts as a police to suspend the blocks which are under the allegation or dispute. Even some disputes and grievances applied through the grievance forms are just squeezed and thrown into the trash cans. Also most of the time the Department act as a dictator of the company to deprive the privileges and rights of the small holder grower to speak out on some unfair issues the company is practicing; they implement agendas and ideas for the interest of the Company and undermine the wellbeing and freedom expression and speech from the smallholder growers. BUFFER ZONE EXPLOITATION: THE Company, NBPOL is exploiting the 20 metre buffer zone limit, photos below shown: Kumbango Plantation beside Dagi River bank and clearing for new replant.Our mighty Dagi river has caused enormous flooding, great land mass devastation and erosion due to mass deforestations and buffer zone exploitations. The river itself has gone very tinny, when we were kids, everybody crossed this river only by swimming; but today its only ankle deep, we just walk across it. I usually live just on the other side of this river; this river is my livelihood.WASTE DISPOSAL INTO THE RIVER: Kumbango Plantation workers are dumping waste metal junks and workshop junks into our Dagi river bank. Photos shown below: Workshop waste thrown beside roadside just 20 metres away from our Dagi River Bank.BIO GAS ELECTRICITY POWER PLANT: The company has set up two (2) Bio Gas Electricity Power Plants, one at Mosa Oil Mill, and the other one at Kumbango Oil Mill. The Plants generate enormous supply of electricity which is more than enough to feed the whole province with surplus. The Plants act as the step up electricity supply to the Electricity Commission of PNG which rakes in PGK millions on a monthly basis. We the Small Holder Growers are being left out of the income revenue because the plant is also run by the waste of the FFB Palm Oil which we supply to the company. If they dont share with us the income revenue, at least the company must feed the electricity supply to our respective homes as well to be part beneficiaries of the development. Photos of the Plants are shown below: EXESSIVE DEDUCTIONS: Also the company is placing excessive deductions on our small FFB Palm Oil Income Revenue to run its operation. All our toils are being watered down just to receive a lousy PGK 170, per pay day, even though the price of the Palm Oil is very high at the World Market in US Dollars. The lousy PGK 170 is equivalent to a lousy USD50.PRICING FORMULAI kindly ask the RSPO Board of Panel to help the Small Holder Growers to liaise with the company and review the pricing formula which they are using to pay the growers. REVIEW CONTRACT AGREEMENT: The CONTRACT AGREEMENT between the company and the Smallholder Growers were set in place by the Harrisons and Crossfield and the Australian Government in the early stages of our Oil Palm Development Project in 1967. Most of the policies and agreements set in place were for the beneficiary and gain of the manipulating company under the colonial mindset for the benefits of our ruling masters. The agreement placed the Smallholder Growers in an awkward position where we have no power to do or say in what the company was doing. We are being treated as slaves to the Company, the Government and the Oil Palm Industry. Even though our positive economic input are constant to the economic development of the country and the world as a whole, by supplying a steady tonnage of FFB Palm Oil to the company on a weekly basis. I sincerely urge the RSPO Board to assist us in reviewing the CONTRACT AGREEMENT on a roundtable with the Company and the Hoskins Oil Palm Growers Association (OPGA). The agreement must be satisfactory to both parties under RSPO Protocols and Humanitarian wellbeing.GENERAL HUMANITARIAN WELFARE AND SUSTAINABILITYThis is the forty eight (48) year of the Hoskins Oil Palm Project since 1967. The project have trained us to be good Palm Oil Growers adhering to the Protocols and Principles of the Palm Oil Industry through these prolonged period of time. In those early days when the RSPO Board was not set in place yet, we were taught the general practice and principles on palm oil through the DPI, about how to maintain the cleanliness of our oil palm blocks, homes, drinking water, to have in our custody the land title form, pay rental fees, maintaining boundary pegs, maintaining 100 metres buffer zone, how to apply fertilizers like ammonium phosphate and ammonium nitrite, process of harvesting and upkeeping, selective weeding, how to use chemicals and tools, policies against trespassing unnecessarily to other blocks without given consent from the owner, and maintaining a friendly and peaceful environment. In doing all those things we thought that in return we will receive a higher income to enhance and stabilize our living standards to a modernize standard. But all those hard labor work were all in vain. The price of the FFB Palm Oil is still on its lowest rates since we started in 1967, and even it went down to zero rates some years back. The cost of living are very high, with accumulating prices of goods and services, government GST taxes on every goods and services, high school fees demand, accumulating and extended families living in a single oil palm block. The Palm Oil FFB price and the pay we are receiving cannot sustain all these accumulating necessities of life. To tell the truth, right now we are surviving through subsistence gardening on little bits of reserve land we have. Otherwise weve all been dead. If we preach and talk about RSPO, the commodity we are dealing and working with must be sustainable enough to meet the standards and demands of every parties involved. We the primary producer of the commodity must be sustained and you the end user must be sustained and satisfied. We even cannot do savings to start up some other spinoff businesses. Throughout all these years we toil to nothing. Most of us have to search for optional means and ways for sustainable income to start up other profitable businesses. We live in run down homes with no proper water sanitation, no electricity, no proper health care, no life insurance cover, no proper working machineries. We even cant employ laborers to help us manage some of the work load due to financial incapabilities. All heavy jobs are done manually just by using our own strength. All our pioneering fathers have died young from all sorts of body conditions like; back problems, knee problems, eye problems, heart and kidney failures and many undiagnosed ailments because of high body strain levels with no stabilize diets. Even many of the growers were killed by falling FFBs and palm branches while in the process of harvesting. Others were killed by falling oil palm stumps which have been poisoned, while unknowingly working under them. There was no compensation for all those looses of lives. If we talk RSPO lets all come together on a round table and discuss all these underlying issues for the beneficiary and sustainability of us all under the RSPO concept."

forest,114,"The company concerned has been clearing community lands and destroying natural forests without any reference to RSPO standards. Aerial imagery and official government reports shows that over 5200 hectares of mostly primary forest has been felled since January 20132. Fire is being used to burn cleared timber and other vegetation. Valuable timber resources have also being sold. Community testimony reveals that the company acquired rights to the respective area without any process of engagement or FPIC with the community. Furthermore, the company has been clearing extensive areas of forest without any engagement with the local communities, laying waste to large areas of forest which the communities use for hunting, fishing and gathering and as a source of medicinal plants and materials for construction, killing local wildlife and destroying their vital habitats. The area in question has been historically occupied by residents and their fore parents and includes the locations of numerous former settlements and farms that have since been left to become fallow. The operations have also extracted large volumes of important construction material from the river Aguaytia outside of the lands claimed by Plantaciones de Pucallpa and in the process used and degraded private tracks made by the community and exhausted the resources that the community depends on for their own constructions. The operations have resulted in the destruction of at least one house owned by a community member and have blocking and despoiled the creeks and rivers which the community relies on for their fishing, bathing and drinking waters. Moreover, company personnel restrict access of community members to the area for hunting, fishing and gathering and other subsistence activities. Community testimony highlights that waste materials are being dumped into the water system and all the main streams in the affected lands are no longer fit for drinking and fishing. These include the rivers Sanuya, Sheringal and Churral amongst others. Official investigations conducted by the Ministry of Agriculturehave determined that Plantaciones de Pucallpa has failed to secure the relevant permits required for forest clearance or to conduct the relevant social and environmental impact assessments. The Ministry has consequently ordered the suspension of the operations. In addition, the community understands that the company hired large numbers of people specifically to occupy the area during the field investigations by local authorities in an attempt to deliberately frustrate these visits. This has resulted in an extremely tense and conflictenvironment in which government representatives have even been threatened by company representatives. The extent of social and environmental devastation caused by these operations and the irregularities in permitting has meant these palm oil developments have become a major national controversy, as can be seen on:Despite the suspension order, the community affirms that the company has been promoting the incursion and invasion of third parties in forested areas in areas adjacent to the area cleared by Plantaciones de Pucallpa with the objective of subsequently acquiring these areas. This has resulted in the national indigenous peoples organisation (AIDESEP) to call for the suspension of all oil palm operations in Peru until contradictions and loopholes in the legal framework are resolvedand for the Congressional Commission of the Amazon and Ecology to establish a high level national taskforce to address the issue of large scale agribusiness and social conflict. Although we in the community have been made aware that the company in question is part of a wider network of companies in Peru known locally as los Malaios (the Malays), which are apparently owned by the same proprietors, it was only recently that we established that it was Plantaciones de Pucallpa that was operating in community lands. It has not been possible to identify the full ownership structure of the company and the exact nature of its links to Malaysian companies as many of these companies are registered in offshore tax havens which require limited disclosure of company information. Nevertheless, as a result of the companys own declarations to the RSPOas well as NGO investigationsit appears that these companies are connected to Asian Plantations which in 2014 was bought by FELDA Global Ventures, a founder member of the RSPO. Having now reviewed, the standards which Plantaciones de Pucallpa should be observing as an RSPO member we note the following serious violations.  New Planting Procedure: The company has conducted their operations without filing any prior notifications with the RSPO, large swathes of primary forest have been cleared and no prior HCV or SEIA assessments have been conducted.  Principle 1. Information about the companys plans and operations have never been shared with the community.  Principle 2. The company has acquired lands customarily owned and used by the community of Santa Clara de Uchunya without their free, prior and informed consent.  Principle 3. The company has not provided mechanisms to resolve any of the problems being caused. The company has failed to comply with national laws prohibiting the conversion of primary forest for agricultural purposes, conversion of forest without the corresponding soil studies, environmental permits or relevant environmental and social impact assessments. The company has violated the property rights of indigenous peoples to their customary lands, their right to the natural resources that guarantee their subsistence, their right to processes of prior consultation and consent, their right to determine their own development paths in addition to many other fundamental rights of indigenous peoples which are obligatory in Peru. 9.

mighty,118,"SMALL HOLDERS AFFAIRS: The Small Holders Affairs is a Department of the NBPOL who acts as the mediator and watchdog between us the Small Holder Growers and the Company NBPOL. I acknowledge both the Department and the working Personals within the department which they have assisted us throughout the years. But one of the most disgusting thing is when there is a major dispute between the company and the small holder the Department dont hear the grievances of the Small Holder Growers and act as the mediator to bring the issue right up to the management of the company so we can discuss the issue on a round table and come to a compromise for the beneficiary of us all and the Palm Oil Industry. Instead the Department acts as a police to suspend the blocks which are under the allegation or dispute. Even some disputes and grievances applied through the grievance forms are just squeezed and thrown into the trash cans. Also most of the time the Department act as a dictator of the company to deprive the privileges and rights of the small holder grower to speak out on some unfair issues the company is practicing; they implement agendas and ideas for the interest of the Company and undermine the wellbeing and freedom expression and speech from the smallholder growers. BUFFER ZONE EXPLOITATION: THE Company, NBPOL is exploiting the 20 metre buffer zone limit, photos below shown: Kumbango Plantation beside Dagi River bank and clearing for new replant.Our mighty Dagi river has caused enormous flooding, great land mass devastation and erosion due to mass deforestations and buffer zone exploitations. The river itself has gone very tinny, when we were kids, everybody crossed this river only by swimming; but today its only ankle deep, we just walk across it. I usually live just on the other side of this river; this river is my livelihood.WASTE DISPOSAL INTO THE RIVER: Kumbango Plantation workers are dumping waste metal junks and workshop junks into our Dagi river bank. Photos shown below: Workshop waste thrown beside roadside just 20 metres away from our Dagi River Bank.BIO GAS ELECTRICITY POWER PLANT: The company has set up two (2) Bio Gas Electricity Power Plants, one at Mosa Oil Mill, and the other one at Kumbango Oil Mill. The Plants generate enormous supply of electricity which is more than enough to feed the whole province with surplus. The Plants act as the step up electricity supply to the Electricity Commission of PNG which rakes in PGK millions on a monthly basis. We the Small Holder Growers are being left out of the income revenue because the plant is also run by the waste of the FFB Palm Oil which we supply to the company. If they dont share with us the income revenue, at least the company must feed the electricity supply to our respective homes as well to be part beneficiaries of the development. Photos of the Plants are shown below: EXESSIVE DEDUCTIONS: Also the company is placing excessive deductions on our small FFB Palm Oil Income Revenue to run its operation. All our toils are being watered down just to receive a lousy PGK 170, per pay day, even though the price of the Palm Oil is very high at the World Market in US Dollars. The lousy PGK 170 is equivalent to a lousy USD50.PRICING FORMULAI kindly ask the RSPO Board of Panel to help the Small Holder Growers to liaise with the company and review the pricing formula which they are using to pay the growers. REVIEW CONTRACT AGREEMENT: The CONTRACT AGREEMENT between the company and the Smallholder Growers were set in place by the Harrisons and Crossfield and the Australian Government in the early stages of our Oil Palm Development Project in 1967. Most of the policies and agreements set in place were for the beneficiary and gain of the manipulating company under the colonial mindset for the benefits of our ruling masters. The agreement placed the Smallholder Growers in an awkward position where we have no power to do or say in what the company was doing. We are being treated as slaves to the Company, the Government and the Oil Palm Industry. Even though our positive economic input are constant to the economic development of the country and the world as a whole, by supplying a steady tonnage of FFB Palm Oil to the company on a weekly basis. I sincerely urge the RSPO Board to assist us in reviewing the CONTRACT AGREEMENT on a roundtable with the Company and the Hoskins Oil Palm Growers Association (OPGA). The agreement must be satisfactory to both parties under RSPO Protocols and Humanitarian wellbeing.GENERAL HUMANITARIAN WELFARE AND SUSTAINABILITYThis is the forty eight (48) year of the Hoskins Oil Palm Project since 1967. The project have trained us to be good Palm Oil Growers adhering to the Protocols and Principles of the Palm Oil Industry through these prolonged period of time. In those early days when the RSPO Board was not set in place yet, we were taught the general practice and principles on palm oil through the DPI, about how to maintain the cleanliness of our oil palm blocks, homes, drinking water, to have in our custody the land title form, pay rental fees, maintaining boundary pegs, maintaining 100 metres buffer zone, how to apply fertilizers like ammonium phosphate and ammonium nitrite, process of harvesting and upkeeping, selective weeding, how to use chemicals and tools, policies against trespassing unnecessarily to other blocks without given consent from the owner, and maintaining a friendly and peaceful environment. In doing all those things we thought that in return we will receive a higher income to enhance and stabilize our living standards to a modernize standard. But all those hard labor work were all in vain. The price of the FFB Palm Oil is still on its lowest rates since we started in 1967, and even it went down to zero rates some years back. The cost of living are very high, with accumulating prices of goods and services, government GST taxes on every goods and services, high school fees demand, accumulating and extended families living in a single oil palm block. The Palm Oil FFB price and the pay we are receiving cannot sustain all these accumulating necessities of life. To tell the truth, right now we are surviving through subsistence gardening on little bits of reserve land we have. Otherwise weve all been dead. If we preach and talk about RSPO, the commodity we are dealing and working with must be sustainable enough to meet the standards and demands of every parties involved. We the primary producer of the commodity must be sustained and you the end user must be sustained and satisfied. We even cannot do savings to start up some other spinoff businesses. Throughout all these years we toil to nothing. Most of us have to search for optional means and ways for sustainable income to start up other profitable businesses. We live in run down homes with no proper water sanitation, no electricity, no proper health care, no life insurance cover, no proper working machineries. We even cant employ laborers to help us manage some of the work load due to financial incapabilities. All heavy jobs are done manually just by using our own strength. All our pioneering fathers have died young from all sorts of body conditions like; back problems, knee problems, eye problems, heart and kidney failures and many undiagnosed ailments because of high body strain levels with no stabilize diets. Even many of the growers were killed by falling FFBs and palm branches while in the process of harvesting. Others were killed by falling oil palm stumps which have been poisoned, while unknowingly working under them. There was no compensation for all those looses of lives. If we talk RSPO lets all come together on a round table and discuss all these underlying issues for the beneficiary and sustainability of us all under the RSPO concept."

companies,114,"The company concerned has been clearing community lands and destroying natural forests without any reference to RSPO standards. Aerial imagery and official government reports shows that over 5200 hectares of mostly primary forest has been felled since January 20132. Fire is being used to burn cleared timber and other vegetation. Valuable timber resources have also being sold. Community testimony reveals that the company acquired rights to the respective area without any process of engagement or FPIC with the community. Furthermore, the company has been clearing extensive areas of forest without any engagement with the local communities, laying waste to large areas of forest which the communities use for hunting, fishing and gathering and as a source of medicinal plants and materials for construction, killing local wildlife and destroying their vital habitats. The area in question has been historically occupied by residents and their fore parents and includes the locations of numerous former settlements and farms that have since been left to become fallow. The operations have also extracted large volumes of important construction material from the river Aguaytia outside of the lands claimed by Plantaciones de Pucallpa and in the process used and degraded private tracks made by the community and exhausted the resources that the community depends on for their own constructions. The operations have resulted in the destruction of at least one house owned by a community member and have blocking and despoiled the creeks and rivers which the community relies on for their fishing, bathing and drinking waters. Moreover, company personnel restrict access of community members to the area for hunting, fishing and gathering and other subsistence activities. Community testimony highlights that waste materials are being dumped into the water system and all the main streams in the affected lands are no longer fit for drinking and fishing. These include the rivers Sanuya, Sheringal and Churral amongst others. Official investigations conducted by the Ministry of Agriculturehave determined that Plantaciones de Pucallpa has failed to secure the relevant permits required for forest clearance or to conduct the relevant social and environmental impact assessments. The Ministry has consequently ordered the suspension of the operations. In addition, the community understands that the company hired large numbers of people specifically to occupy the area during the field investigations by local authorities in an attempt to deliberately frustrate these visits. This has resulted in an extremely tense and conflictenvironment in which government representatives have even been threatened by company representatives. The extent of social and environmental devastation caused by these operations and the irregularities in permitting has meant these palm oil developments have become a major national controversy, as can be seen on:Despite the suspension order, the community affirms that the company has been promoting the incursion and invasion of third parties in forested areas in areas adjacent to the area cleared by Plantaciones de Pucallpa with the objective of subsequently acquiring these areas. This has resulted in the national indigenous peoples organisation (AIDESEP) to call for the suspension of all oil palm operations in Peru until contradictions and loopholes in the legal framework are resolvedand for the Congressional Commission of the Amazon and Ecology to establish a high level national taskforce to address the issue of large scale agribusiness and social conflict. Although we in the community have been made aware that the company in question is part of a wider network of companies in Peru known locally as los Malaios (the Malays), which are apparently owned by the same proprietors, it was only recently that we established that it was Plantaciones de Pucallpa that was operating in community lands. It has not been possible to identify the full ownership structure of the company and the exact nature of its links to Malaysian companies as many of these companies are registered in offshore tax havens which require limited disclosure of company information. Nevertheless, as a result of the companys own declarations to the RSPOas well as NGO investigationsit appears that these companies are connected to Asian Plantations which in 2014 was bought by FELDA Global Ventures, a founder member of the RSPO. Having now reviewed, the standards which Plantaciones de Pucallpa should be observing as an RSPO member we note the following serious violations.  New Planting Procedure: The company has conducted their operations without filing any prior notifications with the RSPO, large swathes of primary forest have been cleared and no prior HCV or SEIA assessments have been conducted.  Principle 1. Information about the companys plans and operations have never been shared with the community.  Principle 2. The company has acquired lands customarily owned and used by the community of Santa Clara de Uchunya without their free, prior and informed consent.  Principle 3. The company has not provided mechanisms to resolve any of the problems being caused. The company has failed to comply with national laws prohibiting the conversion of primary forest for agricultural purposes, conversion of forest without the corresponding soil studies, environmental permits or relevant environmental and social impact assessments. The company has violated the property rights of indigenous peoples to their customary lands, their right to the natural resources that guarantee their subsistence, their right to processes of prior consultation and consent, their right to determine their own development paths in addition to many other fundamental rights of indigenous peoples which are obligatory in Peru. 9.  Principle 4. Company operations have destroyed and diverted water courses as well as blocked community access to vital water supplies for fishing and drinking.  Principle 5. No EIA or HCV assessments have been carried out to ensure the protection of the environment, wildlife and the social values of natural ecosystems and mitigate damage. Lands are being cleared with the use of fire.  Principle 6. No participatory SIAs have been carried out. There has been no proper consultation with Santa Clara de Uchunya. Dispute resolution mechanisms are absent. Customary rights have been ignored.  Principle 7. New plantings are being established without ESIAs and HCV assessments, without recognising customary rights and without the communities and indigenous peoples free, prior and informed consent. We here only note the most obvious violations. A more detailed perusal of the RSPO Principles and Criteria shows that there have been multiple violations of many of the Criteria and Indicators associated with the Principles noted above. All these violations of applicable laws are detailed in the Ministry of Agriculture official report referred to in footnote 2 and 3. These obligations flow from ILO Convention 169 and the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of human rights the provisions of which constitute binding obligations for Peru."

palm,118,"SMALL HOLDERS AFFAIRS: The Small Holders Affairs is a Department of the NBPOL who acts as the mediator and watchdog between us the Small Holder Growers and the Company NBPOL. I acknowledge both the Department and the working Personals within the department which they have assisted us throughout the years. But one of the most disgusting thing is when there is a major dispute between the company and the small holder the Department dont hear the grievances of the Small Holder Growers and act as the mediator to bring the issue right up to the management of the company so we can discuss the issue on a round table and come to a compromise for the beneficiary of us all and the Palm Oil Industry. Instead the Department acts as a police to suspend the blocks which are under the allegation or dispute. Even some disputes and grievances applied through the grievance forms are just squeezed and thrown into the trash cans. Also most of the time the Department act as a dictator of the company to deprive the privileges and rights of the small holder grower to speak out on some unfair issues the company is practicing; they implement agendas and ideas for the interest of the Company and undermine the wellbeing and freedom expression and speech from the smallholder growers. BUFFER ZONE EXPLOITATION: THE Company, NBPOL is exploiting the 20 metre buffer zone limit, photos below shown: Kumbango Plantation beside Dagi River bank and clearing for new replant.Our mighty Dagi river has caused enormous flooding, great land mass devastation and erosion due to mass deforestations and buffer zone exploitations. The river itself has gone very tinny, when we were kids, everybody crossed this river only by swimming; but today its only ankle deep, we just walk across it. I usually live just on the other side of this river; this river is my livelihood.WASTE DISPOSAL INTO THE RIVER: Kumbango Plantation workers are dumping waste metal junks and workshop junks into our Dagi river bank. Photos shown below: Workshop waste thrown beside roadside just 20 metres away from our Dagi River Bank.BIO GAS ELECTRICITY POWER PLANT: The company has set up two (2) Bio Gas Electricity Power Plants, one at Mosa Oil Mill, and the other one at Kumbango Oil Mill. The Plants generate enormous supply of electricity which is more than enough to feed the whole province with surplus. The Plants act as the step up electricity supply to the Electricity Commission of PNG which rakes in PGK millions on a monthly basis. We the Small Holder Growers are being left out of the income revenue because the plant is also run by the waste of the FFB Palm Oil which we supply to the company. If they dont share with us the income revenue, at least the company must feed the electricity supply to our respective homes as well to be part beneficiaries of the development. Photos of the Plants are shown below: EXESSIVE DEDUCTIONS: Also the company is placing excessive deductions on our small FFB Palm Oil Income Revenue to run its operation. All our toils are being watered down just to receive a lousy PGK 170, per pay day, even though the price of the Palm Oil is very high at the World Market in US Dollars. The lousy PGK 170 is equivalent to a lousy USD50.PRICING FORMULAI kindly ask the RSPO Board of Panel to help the Small Holder Growers to liaise with the company and review the pricing formula which they are using to pay the growers. REVIEW CONTRACT AGREEMENT: The CONTRACT AGREEMENT between the company and the Smallholder Growers were set in place by the Harrisons and Crossfield and the Australian Government in the early stages of our Oil Palm Development Project in 1967. Most of the policies and agreements set in place were for the beneficiary and gain of the manipulating company under the colonial mindset for the benefits of our ruling masters. The agreement placed the Smallholder Growers in an awkward position where we have no power to do or say in what the company was doing. We are being treated as slaves to the Company, the Government and the Oil Palm Industry. Even though our positive economic input are constant to the economic development of the country and the world as a whole, by supplying a steady tonnage of FFB Palm Oil to the company on a weekly basis. I sincerely urge the RSPO Board to assist us in reviewing the CONTRACT AGREEMENT on a roundtable with the Company and the Hoskins Oil Palm Growers Association (OPGA). The agreement must be satisfactory to both parties under RSPO Protocols and Humanitarian wellbeing.GENERAL HUMANITARIAN WELFARE AND SUSTAINABILITYThis is the forty eight (48) year of the Hoskins Oil Palm Project since 1967. The project have trained us to be good Palm Oil Growers adhering to the Protocols and Principles of the Palm Oil Industry through these prolonged period of time. In those early days when the RSPO Board was not set in place yet, we were taught the general practice and principles on palm oil through the DPI, about how to maintain the cleanliness of our oil palm blocks, homes, drinking water, to have in our custody the land title form, pay rental fees, maintaining boundary pegs, maintaining 100 metres buffer zone, how to apply fertilizers like ammonium phosphate and ammonium nitrite, process of harvesting and upkeeping, selective weeding, how to use chemicals and tools, policies against trespassing unnecessarily to other blocks without given consent from the owner, and maintaining a friendly and peaceful environment. In doing all those things we thought that in return we will receive a higher income to enhance and stabilize our living standards to a modernize standard. But all those hard labor work were all in vain. The price of the FFB Palm Oil is still on its lowest rates since we started in 1967, and even it went down to zero rates some years back. The cost of living are very high, with accumulating prices of goods and services, government GST taxes on every goods and services, high school fees demand, accumulating and extended families living in a single oil palm block. The Palm Oil FFB price and the pay we are receiving cannot sustain all these accumulating necessities of life. To tell the truth, right now we are surviving through subsistence gardening on little bits of reserve land we have. Otherwise weve all been dead. If we preach and talk about RSPO, the commodity we are dealing and working with must be sustainable enough to meet the standards and demands of every parties involved. We the primary producer of the commodity must be sustained and you the end user must be sustained and satisfied. We even cannot do savings to start up some other spinoff businesses. Throughout all these years we toil to nothing. Most of us have to search for optional means and ways for sustainable income to start up other profitable businesses. We live in run down homes with no proper water sanitation, no electricity, no proper health care, no life insurance cover, no proper working machineries. We even cant employ laborers to help us manage some of the work load due to financial incapabilities. All heavy jobs are done manually just by using our own strength. All our pioneering fathers have died young from all sorts of body conditions like; back problems, knee problems, eye problems, heart and kidney failures and many undiagnosed ailments because of high body strain levels with no stabilize diets. Even many of the growers were killed by falling FFBs and palm branches while in the process of harvesting. Others were killed by falling oil palm stumps which have been poisoned, while unknowingly working under them. There was no compensation for all those looses of lives. If we talk RSPO lets all come together on a round table and discuss all these underlying issues for the beneficiary and sustainability of us all under the RSPO concept."

palm,114,"The company concerned has been clearing community lands and destroying natural forests without any reference to RSPO standards. Aerial imagery and official government reports shows that over 5200 hectares of mostly primary forest has been felled since January 20132. Fire is being used to burn cleared timber and other vegetation. Valuable timber resources have also being sold. Community testimony reveals that the company acquired rights to the respective area without any process of engagement or FPIC with the community. Furthermore, the company has been clearing extensive areas of forest without any engagement with the local communities, laying waste to large areas of forest which the communities use for hunting, fishing and gathering and as a source of medicinal plants and materials for construction, killing local wildlife and destroying their vital habitats. The area in question has been historically occupied by residents and their fore parents and includes the locations of numerous former settlements and farms that have since been left to become fallow. The operations have also extracted large volumes of important construction material from the river Aguaytia outside of the lands claimed by Plantaciones de Pucallpa and in the process used and degraded private tracks made by the community and exhausted the resources that the community depends on for their own constructions. The operations have resulted in the destruction of at least one house owned by a community member and have blocking and despoiled the creeks and rivers which the community relies on for their fishing, bathing and drinking waters. Moreover, company personnel restrict access of community members to the area for hunting, fishing and gathering and other subsistence activities. Community testimony highlights that waste materials are being dumped into the water system and all the main streams in the affected lands are no longer fit for drinking and fishing. These include the rivers Sanuya, Sheringal and Churral amongst others. Official investigations conducted by the Ministry of Agriculturehave determined that Plantaciones de Pucallpa has failed to secure the relevant permits required for forest clearance or to conduct the relevant social and environmental impact assessments. The Ministry has consequently ordered the suspension of the operations. In addition, the community understands that the company hired large numbers of people specifically to occupy the area during the field investigations by local authorities in an attempt to deliberately frustrate these visits. This has resulted in an extremely tense and conflictenvironment in which government representatives have even been threatened by company representatives. The extent of social and environmental devastation caused by these operations and the irregularities in permitting has meant these palm oil developments have become a major national controversy, as can be seen on:Despite the suspension order, the community affirms that the company has been promoting the incursion and invasion of third parties in forested areas in areas adjacent to the area cleared by Plantaciones de Pucallpa with the objective of subsequently acquiring these areas. This has resulted in the national indigenous peoples organisation (AIDESEP) to call for the suspension of all oil palm operations in Peru until contradictions and loopholes in the legal framework are resolvedand for the Congressional Commission of the Amazon and Ecology to establish a high level national taskforce to address the issue of large scale agribusiness and social conflict. Although we in the community have been made aware that the company in question is part of a wider network of companies in Peru known locally as los Malaios (the Malays), which are apparently owned by the same proprietors, it was only recently that we established that it was Plantaciones de Pucallpa that was operating in community lands. It has not been possible to identify the full ownership structure of the company and the exact nature of its links to Malaysian companies as many of these companies are registered in offshore tax havens which require limited disclosure of company information. Nevertheless, as a result of the companys own declarations to the RSPOas well as NGO investigationsit appears that these companies are connected to Asian Plantations which in 2014 was bought by FELDA Global Ventures, a founder member of the RSPO. Having now reviewed, the standards which Plantaciones de Pucallpa should be observing as an RSPO member we note the following serious violations.  New Planting Procedure: The company has conducted their operations without filing any prior notifications with the RSPO, large swathes of primary forest have been cleared and no prior HCV or SEIA assessments have been conducted.  Principle 1. Information about the companys plans and operations have never been shared with the community.  Principle 2. The company has acquired lands customarily owned and used by the community of Santa Clara de Uchunya without their free, prior and informed consent.  Principle 3. The company has not provided mechanisms to resolve any of the problems being caused. The company has failed to comply with national laws prohibiting the conversion of primary forest for agricultural purposes, conversion of forest without the corresponding soil studies, environmental permits or relevant environmental and social impact assessments. The company has violated the property rights of indigenous peoples to their customary lands, their right to the natural resources that guarantee their subsistence, their right to processes of prior consultation and consent, their right to determine their own development paths in addition to many other fundamental rights of indigenous peoples which are obligatory in Peru. 9.  Principle 4. Company operations have destroyed and diverted water courses as well as blocked community access to vital water supplies for fishing and drinking.  Principle 5. No EIA or HCV assessments have been carried out to ensure the protection of the environment, wildlife and the social values of natural ecosystems and mitigate damage. Lands are being cleared with the use of fire.  Principle 6. No participatory SIAs have been carried out. There has been no proper consultation with Santa Clara de Uchunya. Dispute resolution mechanisms are absent. Customary rights have been ignored.  Principle 7. New plantings are being established without ESIAs and HCV assessments, without recognising customary rights and without the communities and indigenous peoples free, prior and informed consent. We here only note the most obvious violations. A more detailed perusal of the RSPO Principles and Criteria shows that there have been multiple violations of many of the Criteria and Indicators associated with the Principles noted above. All these violations of applicable laws are detailed in the Ministry of Agriculture official report referred to in footnote 2 and 3. These obligations flow from ILO Convention 169 and the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of human rights the provisions of which constitute binding obligations for Peru."

rights,114,"The company concerned has been clearing community lands and destroying natural forests without any reference to RSPO standards. Aerial imagery and official government reports shows that over 5200 hectares of mostly primary forest has been felled since January 20132. Fire is being used to burn cleared timber and other vegetation. Valuable timber resources have also being sold. Community testimony reveals that the company acquired rights to the respective area without any process of engagement or FPIC with the community. Furthermore, the company has been clearing extensive areas of forest without any engagement with the local communities, laying waste to large areas of forest which the communities use for hunting, fishing and gathering and as a source of medicinal plants and materials for construction, killing local wildlife and destroying their vital habitats. The area in question has been historically occupied by residents and their fore parents and includes the locations of numerous former settlements and farms that have since been left to become fallow. The operations have also extracted large volumes of important construction material from the river Aguaytia outside of the lands claimed by Plantaciones de Pucallpa and in the process used and degraded private tracks made by the community and exhausted the resources that the community depends on for their own constructions. The operations have resulted in the destruction of at least one house owned by a community member and have blocking and despoiled the creeks and rivers which the community relies on for their fishing, bathing and drinking waters. Moreover, company personnel restrict access of community members to the area for hunting, fishing and gathering and other subsistence activities. Community testimony highlights that waste materials are being dumped into the water system and all the main streams in the affected lands are no longer fit for drinking and fishing. These include the rivers Sanuya, Sheringal and Churral amongst others. Official investigations conducted by the Ministry of Agriculturehave determined that Plantaciones de Pucallpa has failed to secure the relevant permits required for forest clearance or to conduct the relevant social and environmental impact assessments. The Ministry has consequently ordered the suspension of the operations. In addition, the community understands that the company hired large numbers of people specifically to occupy the area during the field investigations by local authorities in an attempt to deliberately frustrate these visits. This has resulted in an extremely tense and conflictenvironment in which government representatives have even been threatened by company representatives. The extent of social and environmental devastation caused by these operations and the irregularities in permitting has meant these palm oil developments have become a major national controversy, as can be seen on:Despite the suspension order, the community affirms that the company has been promoting the incursion and invasion of third parties in forested areas in areas adjacent to the area cleared by Plantaciones de Pucallpa with the objective of subsequently acquiring these areas. This has resulted in the national indigenous peoples organisation (AIDESEP) to call for the suspension of all oil palm operations in Peru until contradictions and loopholes in the legal framework are resolvedand for the Congressional Commission of the Amazon and Ecology to establish a high level national taskforce to address the issue of large scale agribusiness and social conflict. Although we in the community have been made aware that the company in question is part of a wider network of companies in Peru known locally as los Malaios (the Malays), which are apparently owned by the same proprietors, it was only recently that we established that it was Plantaciones de Pucallpa that was operating in community lands. It has not been possible to identify the full ownership structure of the company and the exact nature of its links to Malaysian companies as many of these companies are registered in offshore tax havens which require limited disclosure of company information. Nevertheless, as a result of the companys own declarations to the RSPOas well as NGO investigationsit appears that these companies are connected to Asian Plantations which in 2014 was bought by FELDA Global Ventures, a founder member of the RSPO. Having now reviewed, the standards which Plantaciones de Pucallpa should be observing as an RSPO member we note the following serious violations.  New Planting Procedure: The company has conducted their operations without filing any prior notifications with the RSPO, large swathes of primary forest have been cleared and no prior HCV or SEIA assessments have been conducted.  Principle 1. Information about the companys plans and operations have never been shared with the community.  Principle 2. The company has acquired lands customarily owned and used by the community of Santa Clara de Uchunya without their free, prior and informed consent.  Principle 3. The company has not provided mechanisms to resolve any of the problems being caused. The company has failed to comply with national laws prohibiting the conversion of primary forest for agricultural purposes, conversion of forest without the corresponding soil studies, environmental permits or relevant environmental and social impact assessments. The company has violated the property rights of indigenous peoples to their customary lands, their right to the natural resources that guarantee their subsistence, their right to processes of prior consultation and consent, their right to determine their own development paths in addition to many other fundamental rights of indigenous peoples which are obligatory in Peru. 9.  Principle 4. Company operations have destroyed and diverted water courses as well as blocked community access to vital water supplies for fishing and drinking.  Principle 5. No EIA or HCV assessments have been carried out to ensure the protection of the environment, wildlife and the social values of natural ecosystems and mitigate damage. Lands are being cleared with the use of fire.  Principle 6. No participatory SIAs have been carried out. There has been no proper consultation with Santa Clara de Uchunya. Dispute resolution mechanisms are absent. Customary rights have been ignored.  Principle 7. New plantings are being established without ESIAs and HCV assessments, without recognising customary rights and without the communities and indigenous peoples free, prior and informed consent. We here only note the most obvious violations. A more detailed perusal of the RSPO Principles and Criteria shows that there have been multiple violations of many of the Criteria and Indicators associated with the Principles noted above. All these violations of applicable laws are detailed in the Ministry of Agriculture official report referred to in footnote 2 and 3. These obligations flow from ILO Convention 169 and the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of human rights the provisions of which constitute binding obligations for Peru."

rights,118,"SMALL HOLDERS AFFAIRS: The Small Holders Affairs is a Department of the NBPOL who acts as the mediator and watchdog between us the Small Holder Growers and the Company NBPOL. I acknowledge both the Department and the working Personals within the department which they have assisted us throughout the years. But one of the most disgusting thing is when there is a major dispute between the company and the small holder the Department dont hear the grievances of the Small Holder Growers and act as the mediator to bring the issue right up to the management of the company so we can discuss the issue on a round table and come to a compromise for the beneficiary of us all and the Palm Oil Industry. Instead the Department acts as a police to suspend the blocks which are under the allegation or dispute. Even some disputes and grievances applied through the grievance forms are just squeezed and thrown into the trash cans. Also most of the time the Department act as a dictator of the company to deprive the privileges and rights of the small holder grower to speak out on some unfair issues the company is practicing; they implement agendas and ideas for the interest of the Company and undermine the wellbeing and freedom expression and speech from the smallholder growers. BUFFER ZONE EXPLOITATION: THE Company, NBPOL is exploiting the 20 metre buffer zone limit, photos below shown: Kumbango Plantation beside Dagi River bank and clearing for new replant.Our mighty Dagi river has caused enormous flooding, great land mass devastation and erosion due to mass deforestations and buffer zone exploitations. The river itself has gone very tinny, when we were kids, everybody crossed this river only by swimming; but today its only ankle deep, we just walk across it. I usually live just on the other side of this river; this river is my livelihood.WASTE DISPOSAL INTO THE RIVER: Kumbango Plantation workers are dumping waste metal junks and workshop junks into our Dagi river bank. Photos shown below: Workshop waste thrown beside roadside just 20 metres away from our Dagi River Bank.BIO GAS ELECTRICITY POWER PLANT: The company has set up two (2) Bio Gas Electricity Power Plants, one at Mosa Oil Mill, and the other one at Kumbango Oil Mill. The Plants generate enormous supply of electricity which is more than enough to feed the whole province with surplus. The Plants act as the step up electricity supply to the Electricity Commission of PNG which rakes in PGK millions on a monthly basis. We the Small Holder Growers are being left out of the income revenue because the plant is also run by the waste of the FFB Palm Oil which we supply to the company. If they dont share with us the income revenue, at least the company must feed the electricity supply to our respective homes as well to be part beneficiaries of the development. Photos of the Plants are shown below: EXESSIVE DEDUCTIONS: Also the company is placing excessive deductions on our small FFB Palm Oil Income Revenue to run its operation. All our toils are being watered down just to receive a lousy PGK 170, per pay day, even though the price of the Palm Oil is very high at the World Market in US Dollars. The lousy PGK 170 is equivalent to a lousy USD50.PRICING FORMULAI kindly ask the RSPO Board of Panel to help the Small Holder Growers to liaise with the company and review the pricing formula which they are using to pay the growers. REVIEW CONTRACT AGREEMENT: The CONTRACT AGREEMENT between the company and the Smallholder Growers were set in place by the Harrisons and Crossfield and the Australian Government in the early stages of our Oil Palm Development Project in 1967. Most of the policies and agreements set in place were for the beneficiary and gain of the manipulating company under the colonial mindset for the benefits of our ruling masters. The agreement placed the Smallholder Growers in an awkward position where we have no power to do or say in what the company was doing. We are being treated as slaves to the Company, the Government and the Oil Palm Industry. Even though our positive economic input are constant to the economic development of the country and the world as a whole, by supplying a steady tonnage of FFB Palm Oil to the company on a weekly basis. I sincerely urge the RSPO Board to assist us in reviewing the CONTRACT AGREEMENT on a roundtable with the Company and the Hoskins Oil Palm Growers Association (OPGA). The agreement must be satisfactory to both parties under RSPO Protocols and Humanitarian wellbeing.GENERAL HUMANITARIAN WELFARE AND SUSTAINABILITYThis is the forty eight (48) year of the Hoskins Oil Palm Project since 1967. The project have trained us to be good Palm Oil Growers adhering to the Protocols and Principles of the Palm Oil Industry through these prolonged period of time. In those early days when the RSPO Board was not set in place yet, we were taught the general practice and principles on palm oil through the DPI, about how to maintain the cleanliness of our oil palm blocks, homes, drinking water, to have in our custody the land title form, pay rental fees, maintaining boundary pegs, maintaining 100 metres buffer zone, how to apply fertilizers like ammonium phosphate and ammonium nitrite, process of harvesting and upkeeping, selective weeding, how to use chemicals and tools, policies against trespassing unnecessarily to other blocks without given consent from the owner, and maintaining a friendly and peaceful environment. In doing all those things we thought that in return we will receive a higher income to enhance and stabilize our living standards to a modernize standard. But all those hard labor work were all in vain. The price of the FFB Palm Oil is still on its lowest rates since we started in 1967, and even it went down to zero rates some years back. The cost of living are very high, with accumulating prices of goods and services, government GST taxes on every goods and services, high school fees demand, accumulating and extended families living in a single oil palm block. The Palm Oil FFB price and the pay we are receiving cannot sustain all these accumulating necessities of life. To tell the truth, right now we are surviving through subsistence gardening on little bits of reserve land we have. Otherwise weve all been dead. If we preach and talk about RSPO, the commodity we are dealing and working with must be sustainable enough to meet the standards and demands of every parties involved. We the primary producer of the commodity must be sustained and you the end user must be sustained and satisfied. We even cannot do savings to start up some other spinoff businesses. Throughout all these years we toil to nothing. Most of us have to search for optional means and ways for sustainable income to start up other profitable businesses. We live in run down homes with no proper water sanitation, no electricity, no proper health care, no life insurance cover, no proper working machineries. We even cant employ laborers to help us manage some of the work load due to financial incapabilities. All heavy jobs are done manually just by using our own strength. All our pioneering fathers have died young from all sorts of body conditions like; back problems, knee problems, eye problems, heart and kidney failures and many undiagnosed ailments because of high body strain levels with no stabilize diets. Even many of the growers were killed by falling FFBs and palm branches while in the process of harvesting. Others were killed by falling oil palm stumps which have been poisoned, while unknowingly working under them. There was no compensation for all those looses of lives. If we talk RSPO lets all come together on a round table and discuss all these underlying issues for the beneficiary and sustainability of us all under the RSPO concept."

period,118,"SMALL HOLDERS AFFAIRS: The Small Holders Affairs is a Department of the NBPOL who acts as the mediator and watchdog between us the Small Holder Growers and the Company NBPOL. I acknowledge both the Department and the working Personals within the department which they have assisted us throughout the years. But one of the most disgusting thing is when there is a major dispute between the company and the small holder the Department dont hear the grievances of the Small Holder Growers and act as the mediator to bring the issue right up to the management of the company so we can discuss the issue on a round table and come to a compromise for the beneficiary of us all and the Palm Oil Industry. Instead the Department acts as a police to suspend the blocks which are under the allegation or dispute. Even some disputes and grievances applied through the grievance forms are just squeezed and thrown into the trash cans. Also most of the time the Department act as a dictator of the company to deprive the privileges and rights of the small holder grower to speak out on some unfair issues the company is practicing; they implement agendas and ideas for the interest of the Company and undermine the wellbeing and freedom expression and speech from the smallholder growers. BUFFER ZONE EXPLOITATION: THE Company, NBPOL is exploiting the 20 metre buffer zone limit, photos below shown: Kumbango Plantation beside Dagi River bank and clearing for new replant.Our mighty Dagi river has caused enormous flooding, great land mass devastation and erosion due to mass deforestations and buffer zone exploitations. The river itself has gone very tinny, when we were kids, everybody crossed this river only by swimming; but today its only ankle deep, we just walk across it. I usually live just on the other side of this river; this river is my livelihood.WASTE DISPOSAL INTO THE RIVER: Kumbango Plantation workers are dumping waste metal junks and workshop junks into our Dagi river bank. Photos shown below: Workshop waste thrown beside roadside just 20 metres away from our Dagi River Bank.BIO GAS ELECTRICITY POWER PLANT: The company has set up two (2) Bio Gas Electricity Power Plants, one at Mosa Oil Mill, and the other one at Kumbango Oil Mill. The Plants generate enormous supply of electricity which is more than enough to feed the whole province with surplus. The Plants act as the step up electricity supply to the Electricity Commission of PNG which rakes in PGK millions on a monthly basis. We the Small Holder Growers are being left out of the income revenue because the plant is also run by the waste of the FFB Palm Oil which we supply to the company. If they dont share with us the income revenue, at least the company must feed the electricity supply to our respective homes as well to be part beneficiaries of the development. Photos of the Plants are shown below: EXESSIVE DEDUCTIONS: Also the company is placing excessive deductions on our small FFB Palm Oil Income Revenue to run its operation. All our toils are being watered down just to receive a lousy PGK 170, per pay day, even though the price of the Palm Oil is very high at the World Market in US Dollars. The lousy PGK 170 is equivalent to a lousy USD50.PRICING FORMULAI kindly ask the RSPO Board of Panel to help the Small Holder Growers to liaise with the company and review the pricing formula which they are using to pay the growers. REVIEW CONTRACT AGREEMENT: The CONTRACT AGREEMENT between the company and the Smallholder Growers were set in place by the Harrisons and Crossfield and the Australian Government in the early stages of our Oil Palm Development Project in 1967. Most of the policies and agreements set in place were for the beneficiary and gain of the manipulating company under the colonial mindset for the benefits of our ruling masters. The agreement placed the Smallholder Growers in an awkward position where we have no power to do or say in what the company was doing. We are being treated as slaves to the Company, the Government and the Oil Palm Industry. Even though our positive economic input are constant to the economic development of the country and the world as a whole, by supplying a steady tonnage of FFB Palm Oil to the company on a weekly basis. I sincerely urge the RSPO Board to assist us in reviewing the CONTRACT AGREEMENT on a roundtable with the Company and the Hoskins Oil Palm Growers Association (OPGA). The agreement must be satisfactory to both parties under RSPO Protocols and Humanitarian wellbeing.GENERAL HUMANITARIAN WELFARE AND SUSTAINABILITYThis is the forty eight (48) year of the Hoskins Oil Palm Project since 1967. The project have trained us to be good Palm Oil Growers adhering to the Protocols and Principles of the Palm Oil Industry through these prolonged period of time. In those early days when the RSPO Board was not set in place yet, we were taught the general practice and principles on palm oil through the DPI, about how to maintain the cleanliness of our oil palm blocks, homes, drinking water, to have in our custody the land title form, pay rental fees, maintaining boundary pegs, maintaining 100 metres buffer zone, how to apply fertilizers like ammonium phosphate and ammonium nitrite, process of harvesting and upkeeping, selective weeding, how to use chemicals and tools, policies against trespassing unnecessarily to other blocks without given consent from the owner, and maintaining a friendly and peaceful environment. In doing all those things we thought that in return we will receive a higher income to enhance and stabilize our living standards to a modernize standard. But all those hard labor work were all in vain. The price of the FFB Palm Oil is still on its lowest rates since we started in 1967, and even it went down to zero rates some years back. The cost of living are very high, with accumulating prices of goods and services, government GST taxes on every goods and services, high school fees demand, accumulating and extended families living in a single oil palm block. The Palm Oil FFB price and the pay we are receiving cannot sustain all these accumulating necessities of life. To tell the truth, right now we are surviving through subsistence gardening on little bits of reserve land we have. Otherwise weve all been dead. If we preach and talk about RSPO, the commodity we are dealing and working with must be sustainable enough to meet the standards and demands of every parties involved. We the primary producer of the commodity must be sustained and you the end user must be sustained and satisfied. We even cannot do savings to start up some other spinoff businesses. Throughout all these years we toil to nothing. Most of us have to search for optional means and ways for sustainable income to start up other profitable businesses. We live in run down homes with no proper water sanitation, no electricity, no proper health care, no life insurance cover, no proper working machineries. We even cant employ laborers to help us manage some of the work load due to financial incapabilities. All heavy jobs are done manually just by using our own strength. All our pioneering fathers have died young from all sorts of body conditions like; back problems, knee problems, eye problems, heart and kidney failures and many undiagnosed ailments because of high body strain levels with no stabilize diets. Even many of the growers were killed by falling FFBs and palm branches while in the process of harvesting. Others were killed by falling oil palm stumps which have been poisoned, while unknowingly working under them. There was no compensation for all those looses of lives. If we talk RSPO lets all come together on a round table and discuss all these underlying issues for the beneficiary and sustainability of us all under the RSPO concept."

oil,114,"The company concerned has been clearing community lands and destroying natural forests without any reference to RSPO standards. Aerial imagery and official government reports shows that over 5200 hectares of mostly primary forest has been felled since January 20132. Fire is being used to burn cleared timber and other vegetation. Valuable timber resources have also being sold. Community testimony reveals that the company acquired rights to the respective area without any process of engagement or FPIC with the community. Furthermore, the company has been clearing extensive areas of forest without any engagement with the local communities, laying waste to large areas of forest which the communities use for hunting, fishing and gathering and as a source of medicinal plants and materials for construction, killing local wildlife and destroying their vital habitats. The area in question has been historically occupied by residents and their fore parents and includes the locations of numerous former settlements and farms that have since been left to become fallow. The operations have also extracted large volumes of important construction material from the river Aguaytia outside of the lands claimed by Plantaciones de Pucallpa and in the process used and degraded private tracks made by the community and exhausted the resources that the community depends on for their own constructions. The operations have resulted in the destruction of at least one house owned by a community member and have blocking and despoiled the creeks and rivers which the community relies on for their fishing, bathing and drinking waters. Moreover, company personnel restrict access of community members to the area for hunting, fishing and gathering and other subsistence activities. Community testimony highlights that waste materials are being dumped into the water system and all the main streams in the affected lands are no longer fit for drinking and fishing. These include the rivers Sanuya, Sheringal and Churral amongst others. Official investigations conducted by the Ministry of Agriculturehave determined that Plantaciones de Pucallpa has failed to secure the relevant permits required for forest clearance or to conduct the relevant social and environmental impact assessments. The Ministry has consequently ordered the suspension of the operations. In addition, the community understands that the company hired large numbers of people specifically to occupy the area during the field investigations by local authorities in an attempt to deliberately frustrate these visits. This has resulted in an extremely tense and conflictenvironment in which government representatives have even been threatened by company representatives. The extent of social and environmental devastation caused by these operations and the irregularities in permitting has meant these palm oil developments have become a major national controversy, as can be seen on:Despite the suspension order, the community affirms that the company has been promoting the incursion and invasion of third parties in forested areas in areas adjacent to the area cleared by Plantaciones de Pucallpa with the objective of subsequently acquiring these areas. This has resulted in the national indigenous peoples organisation (AIDESEP) to call for the suspension of all oil palm operations in Peru until contradictions and loopholes in the legal framework are resolvedand for the Congressional Commission of the Amazon and Ecology to establish a high level national taskforce to address the issue of large scale agribusiness and social conflict. Although we in the community have been made aware that the company in question is part of a wider network of companies in Peru known locally as los Malaios (the Malays), which are apparently owned by the same proprietors, it was only recently that we established that it was Plantaciones de Pucallpa that was operating in community lands. It has not been possible to identify the full ownership structure of the company and the exact nature of its links to Malaysian companies as many of these companies are registered in offshore tax havens which require limited disclosure of company information. Nevertheless, as a result of the companys own declarations to the RSPOas well as NGO investigationsit appears that these companies are connected to Asian Plantations which in 2014 was bought by FELDA Global Ventures, a founder member of the RSPO. Having now reviewed, the standards which Plantaciones de Pucallpa should be observing as an RSPO member we note the following serious violations.  New Planting Procedure: The company has conducted their operations without filing any prior notifications with the RSPO, large swathes of primary forest have been cleared and no prior HCV or SEIA assessments have been conducted.  Principle 1. Information about the companys plans and operations have never been shared with the community.  Principle 2. The company has acquired lands customarily owned and used by the community of Santa Clara de Uchunya without their free, prior and informed consent.  Principle 3. The company has not provided mechanisms to resolve any of the problems being caused. The company has failed to comply with national laws prohibiting the conversion of primary forest for agricultural purposes, conversion of forest without the corresponding soil studies, environmental permits or relevant environmental and social impact assessments. The company has violated the property rights of indigenous peoples to their customary lands, their right to the natural resources that guarantee their subsistence, their right to processes of prior consultation and consent, their right to determine their own development paths in addition to many other fundamental rights of indigenous peoples which are obligatory in Peru. 9.  Principle 4. Company operations have destroyed and diverted water courses as well as blocked community access to vital water supplies for fishing and drinking.  Principle 5. No EIA or HCV assessments have been carried out to ensure the protection of the environment, wildlife and the social values of natural ecosystems and mitigate damage. Lands are being cleared with the use of fire.  Principle 6. No participatory SIAs have been carried out. There has been no proper consultation with Santa Clara de Uchunya. Dispute resolution mechanisms are absent. Customary rights have been ignored.  Principle 7. New plantings are being established without ESIAs and HCV assessments, without recognising customary rights and without the communities and indigenous peoples free, prior and informed consent. We here only note the most obvious violations. A more detailed perusal of the RSPO Principles and Criteria shows that there have been multiple violations of many of the Criteria and Indicators associated with the Principles noted above. All these violations of applicable laws are detailed in the Ministry of Agriculture official report referred to in footnote 2 and 3. These obligations flow from ILO Convention 169 and the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of human rights the provisions of which constitute binding obligations for Peru."

oil,118,"SMALL HOLDERS AFFAIRS: The Small Holders Affairs is a Department of the NBPOL who acts as the mediator and watchdog between us the Small Holder Growers and the Company NBPOL. I acknowledge both the Department and the working Personals within the department which they have assisted us throughout the years. But one of the most disgusting thing is when there is a major dispute between the company and the small holder the Department dont hear the grievances of the Small Holder Growers and act as the mediator to bring the issue right up to the management of the company so we can discuss the issue on a round table and come to a compromise for the beneficiary of us all and the Palm Oil Industry. Instead the Department acts as a police to suspend the blocks which are under the allegation or dispute. Even some disputes and grievances applied through the grievance forms are just squeezed and thrown into the trash cans. Also most of the time the Department act as a dictator of the company to deprive the privileges and rights of the small holder grower to speak out on some unfair issues the company is practicing; they implement agendas and ideas for the interest of the Company and undermine the wellbeing and freedom expression and speech from the smallholder growers. BUFFER ZONE EXPLOITATION: THE Company, NBPOL is exploiting the 20 metre buffer zone limit, photos below shown: Kumbango Plantation beside Dagi River bank and clearing for new replant.Our mighty Dagi river has caused enormous flooding, great land mass devastation and erosion due to mass deforestations and buffer zone exploitations. The river itself has gone very tinny, when we were kids, everybody crossed this river only by swimming; but today its only ankle deep, we just walk across it. I usually live just on the other side of this river; this river is my livelihood.WASTE DISPOSAL INTO THE RIVER: Kumbango Plantation workers are dumping waste metal junks and workshop junks into our Dagi river bank. Photos shown below: Workshop waste thrown beside roadside just 20 metres away from our Dagi River Bank.BIO GAS ELECTRICITY POWER PLANT: The company has set up two (2) Bio Gas Electricity Power Plants, one at Mosa Oil Mill, and the other one at Kumbango Oil Mill. The Plants generate enormous supply of electricity which is more than enough to feed the whole province with surplus. The Plants act as the step up electricity supply to the Electricity Commission of PNG which rakes in PGK millions on a monthly basis. We the Small Holder Growers are being left out of the income revenue because the plant is also run by the waste of the FFB Palm Oil which we supply to the company. If they dont share with us the income revenue, at least the company must feed the electricity supply to our respective homes as well to be part beneficiaries of the development. Photos of the Plants are shown below: EXESSIVE DEDUCTIONS: Also the company is placing excessive deductions on our small FFB Palm Oil Income Revenue to run its operation. All our toils are being watered down just to receive a lousy PGK 170, per pay day, even though the price of the Palm Oil is very high at the World Market in US Dollars. The lousy PGK 170 is equivalent to a lousy USD50.PRICING FORMULAI kindly ask the RSPO Board of Panel to help the Small Holder Growers to liaise with the company and review the pricing formula which they are using to pay the growers. REVIEW CONTRACT AGREEMENT: The CONTRACT AGREEMENT between the company and the Smallholder Growers were set in place by the Harrisons and Crossfield and the Australian Government in the early stages of our Oil Palm Development Project in 1967. Most of the policies and agreements set in place were for the beneficiary and gain of the manipulating company under the colonial mindset for the benefits of our ruling masters. The agreement placed the Smallholder Growers in an awkward position where we have no power to do or say in what the company was doing. We are being treated as slaves to the Company, the Government and the Oil Palm Industry. Even though our positive economic input are constant to the economic development of the country and the world as a whole, by supplying a steady tonnage of FFB Palm Oil to the company on a weekly basis. I sincerely urge the RSPO Board to assist us in reviewing the CONTRACT AGREEMENT on a roundtable with the Company and the Hoskins Oil Palm Growers Association (OPGA). The agreement must be satisfactory to both parties under RSPO Protocols and Humanitarian wellbeing.GENERAL HUMANITARIAN WELFARE AND SUSTAINABILITYThis is the forty eight (48) year of the Hoskins Oil Palm Project since 1967. The project have trained us to be good Palm Oil Growers adhering to the Protocols and Principles of the Palm Oil Industry through these prolonged period of time. In those early days when the RSPO Board was not set in place yet, we were taught the general practice and principles on palm oil through the DPI, about how to maintain the cleanliness of our oil palm blocks, homes, drinking water, to have in our custody the land title form, pay rental fees, maintaining boundary pegs, maintaining 100 metres buffer zone, how to apply fertilizers like ammonium phosphate and ammonium nitrite, process of harvesting and upkeeping, selective weeding, how to use chemicals and tools, policies against trespassing unnecessarily to other blocks without given consent from the owner, and maintaining a friendly and peaceful environment. In doing all those things we thought that in return we will receive a higher income to enhance and stabilize our living standards to a modernize standard. But all those hard labor work were all in vain. The price of the FFB Palm Oil is still on its lowest rates since we started in 1967, and even it went down to zero rates some years back. The cost of living are very high, with accumulating prices of goods and services, government GST taxes on every goods and services, high school fees demand, accumulating and extended families living in a single oil palm block. The Palm Oil FFB price and the pay we are receiving cannot sustain all these accumulating necessities of life. To tell the truth, right now we are surviving through subsistence gardening on little bits of reserve land we have. Otherwise weve all been dead. If we preach and talk about RSPO, the commodity we are dealing and working with must be sustainable enough to meet the standards and demands of every parties involved. We the primary producer of the commodity must be sustained and you the end user must be sustained and satisfied. We even cannot do savings to start up some other spinoff businesses. Throughout all these years we toil to nothing. Most of us have to search for optional means and ways for sustainable income to start up other profitable businesses. We live in run down homes with no proper water sanitation, no electricity, no proper health care, no life insurance cover, no proper working machineries. We even cant employ laborers to help us manage some of the work load due to financial incapabilities. All heavy jobs are done manually just by using our own strength. All our pioneering fathers have died young from all sorts of body conditions like; back problems, knee problems, eye problems, heart and kidney failures and many undiagnosed ailments because of high body strain levels with no stabilize diets. Even many of the growers were killed by falling FFBs and palm branches while in the process of harvesting. Others were killed by falling oil palm stumps which have been poisoned, while unknowingly working under them. There was no compensation for all those looses of lives. If we talk RSPO lets all come together on a round table and discuss all these underlying issues for the beneficiary and sustainability of us all under the RSPO concept."

Formal complaint lodged by Aidenvironment on 3 April 2015. The Complainant expected these following actions: 1. RSPO to force IOI Group to comply with RSPOs Standards and Procedures, including to enforce RSPOs formal procedures which state that: Failure to address any of the [partial certification] requirements (e)-(h) may lead to certification suspension(s) (consistent with the RSPO Certification Systems document rules on non-compliance) (RSPOCertification Systemsarticle4. 2. 4) and: Members will not make any misleading or unsubstantiated claims about the production, procurement or use of sustainable palm oil.  (RSPO Code of Conduct, article2. 1). 2.All areas opened up by IOI Groups subsidiaries PT SKS and PT BNS in Ketapang up to 1 April 2011 must be excluded from future RSPO certification.3.

clearance,114,"The company concerned has been clearing community lands and destroying natural forests without any reference to RSPO standards. Aerial imagery and official government reports shows that over 5200 hectares of mostly primary forest has been felled since January 20132. Fire is being used to burn cleared timber and other vegetation. Valuable timber resources have also being sold. Community testimony reveals that the company acquired rights to the respective area without any process of engagement or FPIC with the community. Furthermore, the company has been clearing extensive areas of forest without any engagement with the local communities, laying waste to large areas of forest which the communities use for hunting, fishing and gathering and as a source of medicinal plants and materials for construction, killing local wildlife and destroying their vital habitats. The area in question has been historically occupied by residents and their fore parents and includes the locations of numerous former settlements and farms that have since been left to become fallow. The operations have also extracted large volumes of important construction material from the river Aguaytia outside of the lands claimed by Plantaciones de Pucallpa and in the process used and degraded private tracks made by the community and exhausted the resources that the community depends on for their own constructions. The operations have resulted in the destruction of at least one house owned by a community member and have blocking and despoiled the creeks and rivers which the community relies on for their fishing, bathing and drinking waters. Moreover, company personnel restrict access of community members to the area for hunting, fishing and gathering and other subsistence activities. Community testimony highlights that waste materials are being dumped into the water system and all the main streams in the affected lands are no longer fit for drinking and fishing. These include the rivers Sanuya, Sheringal and Churral amongst others. Official investigations conducted by the Ministry of Agriculturehave determined that Plantaciones de Pucallpa has failed to secure the relevant permits required for forest clearance or to conduct the relevant social and environmental impact assessments. The Ministry has consequently ordered the suspension of the operations. In addition, the community understands that the company hired large numbers of people specifically to occupy the area during the field investigations by local authorities in an attempt to deliberately frustrate these visits. This has resulted in an extremely tense and conflictenvironment in which government representatives have even been threatened by company representatives. The extent of social and environmental devastation caused by these operations and the irregularities in permitting has meant these palm oil developments have become a major national controversy, as can be seen on:Despite the suspension order, the community affirms that the company has been promoting the incursion and invasion of third parties in forested areas in areas adjacent to the area cleared by Plantaciones de Pucallpa with the objective of subsequently acquiring these areas. This has resulted in the national indigenous peoples organisation (AIDESEP) to call for the suspension of all oil palm operations in Peru until contradictions and loopholes in the legal framework are resolvedand for the Congressional Commission of the Amazon and Ecology to establish a high level national taskforce to address the issue of large scale agribusiness and social conflict. Although we in the community have been made aware that the company in question is part of a wider network of companies in Peru known locally as los Malaios (the Malays), which are apparently owned by the same proprietors, it was only recently that we established that it was Plantaciones de Pucallpa that was operating in community lands. It has not been possible to identify the full ownership structure of the company and the exact nature of its links to Malaysian companies as many of these companies are registered in offshore tax havens which require limited disclosure of company information. Nevertheless, as a result of the companys own declarations to the RSPOas well as NGO investigationsit appears that these companies are connected to Asian Plantations which in 2014 was bought by FELDA Global Ventures, a founder member of the RSPO. Having now reviewed, the standards which Plantaciones de Pucallpa should be observing as an RSPO member we note the following serious violations.  New Planting Procedure: The company has conducted their operations without filing any prior notifications with the RSPO, large swathes of primary forest have been cleared and no prior HCV or SEIA assessments have been conducted.  Principle 1. Information about the companys plans and operations have never been shared with the community.  Principle 2. The company has acquired lands customarily owned and used by the community of Santa Clara de Uchunya without their free, prior and informed consent.  Principle 3. The company has not provided mechanisms to resolve any of the problems being caused. The company has failed to comply with national laws prohibiting the conversion of primary forest for agricultural purposes, conversion of forest without the corresponding soil studies, environmental permits or relevant environmental and social impact assessments. The company has violated the property rights of indigenous peoples to their customary lands, their right to the natural resources that guarantee their subsistence, their right to processes of prior consultation and consent, their right to determine their own development paths in addition to many other fundamental rights of indigenous peoples which are obligatory in Peru. 9.  Principle 4. Company operations have destroyed and diverted water courses as well as blocked community access to vital water supplies for fishing and drinking.  Principle 5. No EIA or HCV assessments have been carried out to ensure the protection of the environment, wildlife and the social values of natural ecosystems and mitigate damage. Lands are being cleared with the use of fire.  Principle 6. No participatory SIAs have been carried out. There has been no proper consultation with Santa Clara de Uchunya. Dispute resolution mechanisms are absent. Customary rights have been ignored.  Principle 7. New plantings are being established without ESIAs and HCV assessments, without recognising customary rights and without the communities and indigenous peoples free, prior and informed consent. We here only note the most obvious violations. A more detailed perusal of the RSPO Principles and Criteria shows that there have been multiple violations of many of the Criteria and Indicators associated with the Principles noted above. All these violations of applicable laws are detailed in the Ministry of Agriculture official report referred to in footnote 2 and 3. These obligations flow from ILO Convention 169 and the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of human rights the provisions of which constitute binding obligations for Peru."

area,114,"The company concerned has been clearing community lands and destroying natural forests without any reference to RSPO standards. Aerial imagery and official government reports shows that over 5200 hectares of mostly primary forest has been felled since January 20132. Fire is being used to burn cleared timber and other vegetation. Valuable timber resources have also being sold. Community testimony reveals that the company acquired rights to the respective area without any process of engagement or FPIC with the community. Furthermore, the company has been clearing extensive areas of forest without any engagement with the local communities, laying waste to large areas of forest which the communities use for hunting, fishing and gathering and as a source of medicinal plants and materials for construction, killing local wildlife and destroying their vital habitats. The area in question has been historically occupied by residents and their fore parents and includes the locations of numerous former settlements and farms that have since been left to become fallow. The operations have also extracted large volumes of important construction material from the river Aguaytia outside of the lands claimed by Plantaciones de Pucallpa and in the process used and degraded private tracks made by the community and exhausted the resources that the community depends on for their own constructions. The operations have resulted in the destruction of at least one house owned by a community member and have blocking and despoiled the creeks and rivers which the community relies on for their fishing, bathing and drinking waters. Moreover, company personnel restrict access of community members to the area for hunting, fishing and gathering and other subsistence activities. Community testimony highlights that waste materials are being dumped into the water system and all the main streams in the affected lands are no longer fit for drinking and fishing. These include the rivers Sanuya, Sheringal and Churral amongst others. Official investigations conducted by the Ministry of Agriculturehave determined that Plantaciones de Pucallpa has failed to secure the relevant permits required for forest clearance or to conduct the relevant social and environmental impact assessments. The Ministry has consequently ordered the suspension of the operations. In addition, the community understands that the company hired large numbers of people specifically to occupy the area during the field investigations by local authorities in an attempt to deliberately frustrate these visits. This has resulted in an extremely tense and conflictenvironment in which government representatives have even been threatened by company representatives. The extent of social and environmental devastation caused by these operations and the irregularities in permitting has meant these palm oil developments have become a major national controversy, as can be seen on:Despite the suspension order, the community affirms that the company has been promoting the incursion and invasion of third parties in forested areas in areas adjacent to the area cleared by Plantaciones de Pucallpa with the objective of subsequently acquiring these areas. This has resulted in the national indigenous peoples organisation (AIDESEP) to call for the suspension of all oil palm operations in Peru until contradictions and loopholes in the legal framework are resolvedand for the Congressional Commission of the Amazon and Ecology to establish a high level national taskforce to address the issue of large scale agribusiness and social conflict. Although we in the community have been made aware that the company in question is part of a wider network of companies in Peru known locally as los Malaios (the Malays), which are apparently owned by the same proprietors, it was only recently that we established that it was Plantaciones de Pucallpa that was operating in community lands. It has not been possible to identify the full ownership structure of the company and the exact nature of its links to Malaysian companies as many of these companies are registered in offshore tax havens which require limited disclosure of company information. Nevertheless, as a result of the companys own declarations to the RSPOas well as NGO investigationsit appears that these companies are connected to Asian Plantations which in 2014 was bought by FELDA Global Ventures, a founder member of the RSPO. Having now reviewed, the standards which Plantaciones de Pucallpa should be observing as an RSPO member we note the following serious violations.  New Planting Procedure: The company has conducted their operations without filing any prior notifications with the RSPO, large swathes of primary forest have been cleared and no prior HCV or SEIA assessments have been conducted.  Principle 1. Information about the companys plans and operations have never been shared with the community.  Principle 2. The company has acquired lands customarily owned and used by the community of Santa Clara de Uchunya without their free, prior and informed consent.  Principle 3. The company has not provided mechanisms to resolve any of the problems being caused. The company has failed to comply with national laws prohibiting the conversion of primary forest for agricultural purposes, conversion of forest without the corresponding soil studies, environmental permits or relevant environmental and social impact assessments. The company has violated the property rights of indigenous peoples to their customary lands, their right to the natural resources that guarantee their subsistence, their right to processes of prior consultation and consent, their right to determine their own development paths in addition to many other fundamental rights of indigenous peoples which are obligatory in Peru. 9.  Principle 4. Company operations have destroyed and diverted water courses as well as blocked community access to vital water supplies for fishing and drinking.  Principle 5. No EIA or HCV assessments have been carried out to ensure the protection of the environment, wildlife and the social values of natural ecosystems and mitigate damage. Lands are being cleared with the use of fire.  Principle 6. No participatory SIAs have been carried out. There has been no proper consultation with Santa Clara de Uchunya. Dispute resolution mechanisms are absent. Customary rights have been ignored.  Principle 7. New plantings are being established without ESIAs and HCV assessments, without recognising customary rights and without the communities and indigenous peoples free, prior and informed consent. We here only note the most obvious violations. A more detailed perusal of the RSPO Principles and Criteria shows that there have been multiple violations of many of the Criteria and Indicators associated with the Principles noted above. All these violations of applicable laws are detailed in the Ministry of Agriculture official report referred to in footnote 2 and 3. These obligations flow from ILO Convention 169 and the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court of human rights the provisions of which constitute binding obligations for Peru."
