In the report, EOF listed findings by EoF investigations involving 43 oil palm plantation management units which are located in Forest Estates based on Ministerial Decree number 903/MENLHK/SETJEN/PLA. 2/12/2016, 07 December 2016 on Forest Estate in Riau Province. We have identified nine GAR supplier companies mentioned in the report, namely Tri Bakti Sarimas (Bukit Payung Mill), PT Gandaerah Hendana, PT Inecda Plantation, PT Peputra Supra Jaya, PTPN V, PT Sekar Bumi Alam Lestari, PT Surya Agrolika Reksa, PT Tasma Puja (Indragiri Hulu Mill and Kampar Mill), and PT Tunggal Perkasa Plantation. Since the publication of the report, we have conducted investigations and engaged with the companies. The grievance handling for each case of the supplier companies has been lodged in the GAR grievance tracker and is being updated regularly in order that our stakeholders can follow the progress.","In the report, EOF stated the following allegations:In February 2019, EoF team conducted field observations of oil palm plantation managed by a state-owned enterprise PT Perkebunan Nusantara V (PTPN V) located in Desa Pesikaian, Cerenti sub-district of Kuantan Singingi district. Based on the field observation, PTPN V Pesikaian had 2,438 hectares of oil palm plantation estimated at 14 years old. An overlay of PTPN V Pesikaian area with Forest Estates indicated that 1,268 hectares of PTPN V plantation is situated in Production Forest and 124 hectares situated in Convertible Production Forest (HPK). BPN (2016) shows that PTPN V Pesikaian had no HGU permit. In addition to this, Basis Data Spasial Kehutanan 2016 Book shows that PTPN V Pesikaian had no Forest Estate release permit. 20/5/21: GAR sent a letter to PTPN V management and asked for feedback. 27/10/21: GAR held a SMART SPOT webinar on Sustainability of Business Activities in Forest Areas after the issuance of the Job Creation Law and Settlement Steps. This was attended by 70 participants from third-party suppliers. This event featured speakers from the Director-General of Inauguration and Management of Forest Areas - Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Directorate General of Plantations - Ministry of Agriculture, Plantation Service of Riau Province and the National Land Agency of Riau Province Regional Office. The objective of this event was to provide information to and raise awareness amongst relevant supplier companies. 10/3/22: To date, no response has been received from PTPN 5 management. PTPN 5 is a state-owned palm oil company. Despite the absence ofa certification record for the Pesikaian estate, we noted PTPN 5 has RSPO and ISPO certification for some other mills/estates. We also noted that GAR does not directly source from the Pesikaian mill/estate. GAR continues to monitor the case and engage with PTPN 5.",,

The report alleged human rights abuses on plantations in Indonesia, including forced labour and child labour, gender discrimination, as well as exploitative and dangerous working practices that put health of workers at risk. The report implicated Wilmar’s supplier, PT Sarana Prima Multi Niaga (PT SPMN), a wholly owned entity under TSH Group. Wilmar immediately reached out to PT SPMN to seek clarification on the allegations. On 20 December 2016, Wilmar and its consultant TFT (now known as Earthworm Foundation), met with PT SPMN to discuss the allegations raised in the AI’s report in further detail. Separately, PT SPMN has been engaged within various RSPO processes since early 2017 subsequent to the publication of the report. The engagement between RSPO and PT SPMN on the allegations are summarized are follows: • On 22 March 2017, RSPO first contacted TSH regarding a response to AI’s report. • On 20 November 2017, TSH Sustainability Team presented progress report on Corrective Actions taken to address AI’s findings to the RSPO. • In November 2017, RSPO commissioned Profundo, a non-for-profit organization, to conduct an independent labor assessment in PT SPMN. The objective of the assessment was to evaluate labor practices and identify any areas for improvement. The assessment was carried out from 27 to 28 November 2017. • On 7 February 2018, Profundo produced a report on the assessment's findings. On 29 May 2018, PT SPMN appointed MEC as an independent party to review and strengthen their action plan including monitoring of issues raised in the AI’s November 2016 report. Actions initiated by PT SPMN to address Profundo’s initial findings were noted and assessed by MEC. In September 2018, Time Bound Action Plan was developed and was subsequently submitted to RSPO for review. The Time Bound Action Plan includes corrective action for both Group and Estate Level Management. The time frame identified for this management exercise to be effective is 16 months, starting from September 2018 and ending in December 2019. The management actions were presented and discussed with the company at both estate and group levels prior to finalizing the action plan. The company initiated implementation of the actions early September 2018, and independent monitoring is to be undertaken by MEC every 4 months. In December 2018, 1st review and field verification conducted by MEC on labor and social compliance. In May 2019, 2nd review and field verification conducted by MEC on labor and social compliance. In May 2019, Wilmar carried out a field visit to assess PT SPMN’s labor practices. During its visit, PT SPMN reiterated its commitment to implementing No Exploitation in its business practices. PT SPMN alongside their commitment to Wilmar NDPE policy, had enhanced or and established following policies pertaining human rights: i. Human Rights & Responsible business, ii. Freedom of association, iii. Sexual Harassment, iv. Equal opportunity & Discrimination, v. Occupational Safety & Health and Child Labor policy. In October 2019, 3rd and final review and field verification conducted by MEC on labor and social compliance. During the course of investigation on this case, PT SPMN consistently provided updates and evidence of their efforts and improvements made on the ground. Wilmar also closely monitored the progress of actions and improvements on the labor and social issues in PT SPMN. SPMN has shown substantial progress in their labor and social practices, fulfilling all the recommendations outlined in the assessment.",https://www.wilmar-international.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/sustainability/grievance/asa2151842016english_the-great-palm-oil-scandal.pdf?sfvrsn=d4630ec8_2,
358,Wilmar International,,Closed,6/30/2021,,,,,Finnwatch,IOI Corporation Berhad (IOI),,,,,"Wilmar immediately initiated engagement with IOI when the allegations were brought to our attention in June 2021. Full details of this case is available on IOI’s grievance list.We understand that Finnwatch has engaged with IOI since August 2020, where they have informed IOI of several allegations highlighted by a grievance raiser on behalf of five workers, consisting of: On 2 June 2023, RSPO Complaint Panel who investigated the case has dismissed the case. For more information on RSPO’s deliberation, please refer to the case tracker. Mistreatment from the estate’s supervisor Inconsistency in issuance of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Not allowing workers to speak to auditors Dissatisfaction regarding housing facilities Disagreement in wage payments Alleged payment of recruitment fees Following this, IOI immediately formed an internal investigation team to address the allegations. On 11 September 2020, IOI updated Finnwatch on the matter of mistreatment, issuance of PPE and the worker being disallowed from speaking to auditors. In the update, IOI included explanations on the regular issuance of PPEs, and that in IOI, there was no restriction placed on auditors with regards to who they choose to interview during audits. IOI also disputed the allegation that workers were not allowed to speak with auditors. IOI further acknowledged that there was an incident of mistreatment of a worker by an estate employee and clarified that action had been taken by IOI management against the employee in question. On 14 October 2020, IOI provided supporting documents, photos and videos from its internal investigations to Finnwatch on the issue of wage disagreement, and dissatisfaction regarding housing facilities. On 13 November 2020, IOI informed Finnwatch that on the issue of illegal payments made during recruitment by the aggrieved workers, IOI had made several attempts to contact the person involved but was not successful. On 16 December 2020, IOI presented its “Guideline for Providing Basic Amenities to Workers” which ensures uniform implementation of amenities provided to all estate workers, and a guideline on “Worker’s Work Verification”, which enables workers to verify their working hours. IOI also shared updates with Finnwatch on progress made with regards to workers’ repatriation back to India. On the issue of recruitment fee, IOI provided reassurance to Finnwatch that investigations were ongoing on the matter, in line with IOI’s No Recruitment Fee policy. On 23 February 2021, IOI informed Finnwatch that it had no way of confirming transactions that had occurred in India relating to recruitment fees. In response to the issue however, IOI suspended the recruitment agency involved as well as recruitment of workers from India, and added that it would be reporting the findings to authorities in India for further formal investigation. On 28 June 2021, IOI reiterated that the issue of illegal monies collected from workers in India for recruitment was beyond their jurisdiction and would require cooperation from the Indian government. On 2 July 2021, IOI published a Statement in Response to Finnwatch’s Report addressing the allegations. In the Statement, IOI also reaffirmed commitment to its “No Recruitment Fees Policy” since 2017, highlighted its “Guideline for Minimum Wage & Leave Pay” and “Worker’s Work Verification Guideline”, and mentioned that it will be undergoing an audit on its plantation operating units to ascertain non-compliance with its labour policies or unsatisfactory working conditions. On 21 July 2021, IOI published an update on its first virtual Sustainability Consultation Forum. IOI engaged BSR (Business for Social Responsibility) to develop and facilitate the Forum, which was held in May 2021 and attended by 40 of IOI’s internal and external stakeholders. Discussions at the Forum were centred around efforts to address current labour challenges faced by IOI and the Malaysian palm oil sector, with a specific focus on Responsible Recruitment Practices especially in Peninsular Malaysia and legalisation of undocumented workers in Sabah. An Executive Summary of the Forum can be found here. On 13 January 2022, IOI published a further update on outcomes and action plans arising from the Forum, which includes active engagement with relevant stakeholders such as RSPO and ILO to develop solutions for responsible recruitment practices, and the setting up of a working group to discuss approaches to legalise undocumented workers in Sabah. Further details are available here. On 2 June 2023, the RSPO Complaints Panel concluded its investigation into the allegations and dismissed the case.

354,Wilmar International,,Closed,9/19/2022,,,,,Rainforest Action Network (RAN),Runding Putra Persada,,,,,"Non-compliant palm products from Mr. Mahmudin, a smallholder operating in the Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve (RSWR) area allegedly entered Wilmar’s supply chain through its supplier, PT Runding Putra Persada (PT RPP) via a Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) dealer CV Buana Indah (CV BI).Wilmar does not source from CV BI. However, our supplier, PT RPP was allegedly sourcing from CV BI. Wilmar immediately initiated engagement with PT RPP when allegations of their non-compliant sourcing within RSWR was brought to our attention in September 2022. According to the report, Mr. Mahmudin was operating illegally within RSWR and was supplying to PT RPP via CV BI. On 31 October 2022, RAN published additional information on the case titled “Major Indonesian Palm Oil Suppliers Falsely Deny Sourcing Illegal Palm Oil” on the issue linked to Mr. Mahmudin’s farm that allegedly extends beyond the boundary of the RSWR. A series of meeting and engagement with PT RPP was carried out thereafter. A field verification from 7 to 15 November 2022 has been carried out to verify the allegation and to support the development of an action plan to address the issues identified. The field visit concluded that Mr Mahmudin has a certificate of ownership (SHM) covering an area of 29 hectares. However, he has further claimed ownership of additional 4 hectares within RSWR which has not yet been allocated SHM. In addition, Mr Mahmudin’s FFB collection point also lacks adequate traceability mechanism to map the FFB that are sourced from the local community farms around Mr Mahmudin's farm. It has been confirmed that CV BI is indeed PT RPP’s supplier, which they have started sourcing since April 2022. The outcome of the investigation and the action plan were discussed with RAN on 1 December 2022. The final field verification report has also been shared with RAN on 21 December 2022. In March 2023, a verification field visit was undertaken to assess the progress of the action plan. It was found that PT RPP has made improvements to the traceability system but the supply chain data collection at CV BI and the handover of 4 hectares of Mr. Mahmudin's land inside RSWR were progressing slower than expected. In order to accelerate progress to meet the action plan targets by June 2023, further assistance will be extended to PT RPP on its traceability programme and our team will engage with Mr. Mahmudin and CV BI in May 2023. The full report is available here. In May 2023, a follow up field visit was carried out. PT RPP has achieved 94% Traceability to Plantation (TtP) and its staff have been trained on the traceability system. After a delayed start on the traceability mapping process due to unforeseen circumstances, Koltiva began the traceability work on CV BI’s and Mr Mahmudin’s suppliers in March and May 2023 respectively. Thus, Koltiva has revised timeline for 100% TtP to September 2023. During this visit, the field team also discussed with Mr. Mahmudin on the progress of the land release of the 4 hectares. In early June 2023, our team met with Balai Konservasi & Sumber Daya Alam, BKSDA (Agency of Conservation and Natural Resources) as the authority for management and monitoring of RSWR, and Balai Pemantapan Kawasan Hutan, BPKH (Agency of Forest Area Consolidation Center) as the authority for boundary marking of RSWR, with the aim to understand the management and monitoring of RSWR, and process of releasing land occupied by community within the RSWR. In June 2023, another follow up field visit was carried out. Mr. Mahmudin was not available to meet with field team during this field visit. The field team was later informed that Mr. Mahmudin was not willing to sign the commitment letter to release the 4 hectares. Consequently, PT RPP and CV BI have issued a statement on 13 July 2023 to exclude Mr. Mahmudin from their supply chain. With this latest development, Wilmar has also included Mr. Mahmudin on its list of “high risk” FFB supplier, where all Wilmar direct suppliers operating within the 50km radius of the Leuser Ecosystem will be notified on the development of this case. Mr. Mahmudin’s FFB will only be allowed to enter their supply chain when the case is resolved to our satisfaction. A verification visit was carried out in October 2023 to assess PT RPP and CV BI’s progress in achieving 100% traceability. The documents and traceability data provided by PT RPP and CV BI, developed with support from Koltiva, showed that the 100% TtP has been achieved. The traceability data also indicated that neither PT RPP nor CV BI has sourced FFB from Mr. Mahmudin since 13 July 2023, when both PT RPP and CV BI issued a statement to exclude Mr. Mahmudin from their supply chain. In addition, PT. RPP has also carried out an evaluation of all CV BI suppliers to ensure that all FFB supply is sourced from outside of the RSWR. Considering that PT. RPP has completed the required activities as per the agreed action plan, the case on PT. RPP can be considered resolved. The summary of the outcome of the investigation and key milestone are available in this Joint Closing Statement. At the landscape level at Leuser, we are committed to ongoing engagement with direct and broader stakeholders in the Leuser landscape, including local communities, smallholders, and relevant government agencies, including some companies listed in RAN’s reports. This includes organizing workshops for smallholder capacity building and raising awareness about forest protection, particularly in the Rawa Singkil Wildlife Reserve (RSWR). Our latest workshop, held on 15 May 2024, included local government institutions, CSOs, RAN, companies operating in the region, smallholders, and communities. The workshop focused on government regulations and management in the Southern Aceh landscape, our sourcing policy, traceability, and grievance handling mechanisms. The workshop was also featured in local media here and here. In October 2024, a field visit was conducted as part of the ongoing monitoring of PT RPP’s TtP implementation. The assessment confirmed that PT RPP remains committed to their written assurance dated 12 July 2023, which states they will not source FFB from Mr. Mahmudin’s plantation. Additionally, the verification team observed progress in enhancing traceability documentation among FFB suppliers, including new farmers working with PT RPP’s dealers. Although many of these dealers operate some distance from the RSWR, they have reaffirmed their commitment not to source FFB from these areas. In November 2024, RAN released a new report titled “Orangutan Capital’ Under Siege” regarding cases linked to deforestation and the sourcing of non-compliant palm oil in the Leuser region. While none of Wilmar’s direct suppliers are implicated in the report, we remain committed to continuing our engagement with both direct and broader stakeholders in the Leuser landscape to address the concerns of deforestation at the landscape level.",https://www.ran.org/leuser-watch/carbon-bomb-scandals-big-brands-driving-climate-disaster-for-palm-oil/,

404,Wilmar International,,Closed,5/6/2015,,,,,Greenomics Indonesia,Mopoli Raya,,,,Alleged clearance of potential High Carbon Stock (HCS) forest by Mopoli Raya in the Leuser Ecosystem.,"Dialogue was initiated with Mopoli Raya on 8 May 2015, while verification of Greenomics report was ongoing. A few more meetings were held thereafter. Wilmar has put on hold purchases, where our last purchase was in 9 July 2015 pending resolution of this matter to Wilmar’s satisfaction. Mopoli Raya had engaged a registered consultant in September 2015 to conduct HCS preliminary study and HCV pre-identification study in 2015 as per Wilmar’s recommendation at PT Aloer Timur. A total area of around 1200 ha as HCS areas was identified and the assessment report was shared with Wilmar in February 2016. Mopoli Raya has committed to adhere to the recommendations made by the consultant and continue to adhere to the moratorium which has been put in place since July 2015. However, based on Wilmar’s ongoing desktop monitoring, land clearing was detected in the HCS areas. PT Aloer Timur clarified that the land clearing was a result of illegal encroachment. Wilmar met with Mopoli Raya on 17 March 2017 and 28 July 2017 to discuss the community encroachment challenges in their concession. Together with Earthworm Foundation (EF), Wilmar conducted two field visits to PT Aloer Timur in December 2017 and April 2018 to verify the situation on the ground. Based on the visits result, it was confirmed that deforestation since 2015 was carried out by external parties who were not part of the local community and had illegally occupied PT Aloer Timur’s land permit area and undertaken illegal logging. Wilmar has agreed to provide assistance to guide PT Aloer Timur in addressing the issues of illegal occupation which contributed to the ongoing deforestation, where Wilmar and EF will carry out a facilitation program at PT Aloer Timur. Through this program, which has commenced since November 2018, Wilmar and EF has planned to visit PT Aloer Timur four times over nine months and at each visit, Wilmar and EF will carry out work to help improving PT Aloer Timur’s capacity and provide strategic guidance to implement the action plan. With the commencement of the facilitation program, Wilmar has resumed business relationship with Mopoli Raya. The first facilitation visit was undertaken on 27 November -3 December 2018, here is the executive summary in English and Bahasa. Building on our NDPE commitment, Wilmar continuously strives to support our suppliers to align their practices with ours towards the journey of compliance. Success stories of Wilmar's re-engagement with Mopoli Raya and another former suspended suppliers can be found here.

PT PSJ is estimated to control a land of 10,271 hectares. Data issued by Riau BPN National Land Agency in 2016 shows that PT PSJ had no HGU permit. Field observation by EoF team indicates PT PSJ's plantation to be 2-15 years old in age. An overlay of PT PSJ oil palm plantation with Forest Estates shows that 4,242 out of the total 10,271 hectares of PSJ's plantation is in Forest Estates: 167 hectares in Limited Production Forest (HPT), 4,058 hectares in Production Forest (HP) and 17 hectares in Convertible Production Forest (HPK). Allegedly, PT PSJ plantation encroaches an Industrial Timber Plantation concession of PT Nusa Wana Raya who has a permit for 26,880 hectares area (Decree of Forestry Minister number 241/Menhut-II/2007 dated 19 July 2007). In 2017, PT PSJ was brought to justice over an allegation of occupying 2,000 hectares of state's land without any proper permit. In May 2019, the Supreme Court penalized PT PSJ for being guilty of illegally planting oil palm plantation without holding any permit. PT PSJ was also found guilty by the Supreme Court and must abandon the 3,323 hectares area of production forest in Pelalawan. Apart from illegal land occupying, Suhardiman Amby, former Chairman of Riau DPRD Special Committee to Monitor and Evaluate Oil Palm Plantation Licensing accused PT PSJ of committing tax evasion. The Special Committee found that the company had only 1,500 hectares with permit, while the area they managed was quite larger and the Supreme Court judged that 3,323 hectares PT PSJ managed was illegal. 'June 2021: GAR was already aware of the disputed area of 3,323 hectares production forest in Pelalawan mentioned in the EOF report.

313,Golden Agri-Resources,148,Closed,5/7/2021,,3/15/2024,,,Eyes on the Forest (EoF),Gandaerah Hendana,,,Samsung C&T,"In May/June 2021, Eyes On the Forest (EOF) published a report titled 'Omnibus Law is not an automatic legalization of illegal plantations - EoF investigation of Riau's illegal oil palm plantations and trade of illegal fruit'.  In the report, EOF listed findings by EoF investigations involving 43 oil palm plantation management units which are located in Forest Estates based on Ministerial Decree number 903/MENLHK/SETJEN/PLA. 2/12/2016, 07 December 2016 on Forest Estate in Riau Province. We have identified nine GAR supplier companies mentioned in the report, namely Tri Bakti Sarimas (Bukit Payung Mill), PT Gandaerah Hendana, PT Inecda Plantation, PT Peputra Supra Jaya, PTPN V, PT Sekar Bumi Alam Lestari, PT Surya Agrolika Reksa, PT Tasma Puja (Indragiri Hulu Mill and Kampar Mill), and PT Tunggal Perkasa Plantation. Since the publication of the report, we have conducted investigations and engaged with the companies. The grievance handling for each case of the supplier companies has been lodged in the GAR grievance tracker and is being updated regularly in order that our stakeholders can follow the progress.","May/Jun/21 In the report, EOF wrote:'PT Gandaerah Hendana is a GAMA Group group having a palm oil plantation located in 2 districts: Pelalawan District (Desa Ukui II, Ukui sub-district and Desa Kerumutan, Kerumutan sub-district) and Indragiri Hulu District (Desa Banjar Balam and Desa Redang Seko, of Lirik sub-district). EoF observation on the ground in March 2019, found oil palm plantation of PT Gandaerah Hendana to be 8-12 years old. Basis Data Spasial Kehutanan 2016 Book lists a Forest Estate release permit for PT Gandaerah Hendana with 12,775 hectares based on SK 806/KPTS-II/1993 dated 30 November 1993. PT Gandaerah Hendana has 16,849 hectares of oil palm plantation in total based on satellite image 2015, 13,871 hectares is situated in a HGU area (BPN Data 2016) and 2,978 hectares outside the HGU and no other HGU. An overlay of PT Gandaerah Hendana plantation with Forest Estates indicates that 583 hectares of oil palm plantation in HGU area overlap with Forest Estates: 211 hectares in Production Forest (HP) and 362 hectares in Convertible Production Forest (HPK). In addition, 2,388 ha of oil palm plantation without HGU are located in Forest Estates: 1,589 hectares in Production Forest (HP) and 799 hectares in Convertible Production Forest HPK. '20/5/21: GAR shared the EOF report with Samsung C&amp;T and asked for feedback. We would like to stress that PT Gandaerah Hendana and PT Inecda are part of Samsung C&amp;T group, not GAMA group as stated in the report. 7/6/21: PT Gandaerah Hendana and PT Inecda sent clarification/response letter to GAR. See letter here26/7/21: As stated in the EOF report, Riau Province has 47% (2. 5 million hectares) of its oil palm plantations in 2019/2020 in Forest Estates. PT Gandaerah Hendana and PT Inecda's situation is not unique and is one of the toughest industry challenges. We understand that PT GH and PT Inecda had obtained all mandatory permits including HGU certificates ranging from 1991 to 1999, whereas the Ministerial Decree for the forest area was enacted in 2016. In addition, we also noted that PT GH and PT Inecda have RSPO and ISPO certification. 27/10/21: GAR held a SMART SPOT webinar on Sustainability of Business Activities in Forest Areas after the issuance of the Job Creation Law and Settlement Steps. This was attended by 70 participants from third-party suppliers. This event featured speakers from the Director-General of Inauguration and Management of Forest Areas - Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Directorate General of Plantations - Ministry of Agriculture, Plantation Service of Riau Province and the National Land Agency of Riau Province Regional Office. The objective of this event was to provide information to and raise awareness amongst relevant supplier companies. 10/3/22: To support suppliers towards 100% TTP, GAR has enrolled PT GH and PT Inecda in our traceability programme 'Ksatria Sawit' since 2019. Their progress is satisfactory. Currently, PT GH and PT Inecda have achieved 98% and 99% TTP respectively. We expect them to achieve 100% TTP in 2022.",,

Based on the supporting document submitted by supplier, it was clarified that the deforestation happened outside their concession boundary. PMI did not carry out any land clearing inside their concession for oil palm development. First meeting with PMI was conducted in May 2019, where Wilmar has reiterated the NDPE policy compliance. PMI had also provided written confirmation to the commitment of NDPE policy and shared their concession map for our ongoing monitoring.We continue to monitor the case and our internal monitoring report in October 2019 has detected land clearing at PT PMI. During our investigation and engagement with PMI, it was clarified that the area has already being felled several years ago and now being cleared for planting. However, as there was no HCS/HCV assessment conducted, we considered this as a non-compliant to the NDPE policy. PMI has committed to immediate moratorium and we continue to guide PMI in NDPE policy compliance.Due to non-compliance to the NDPE policy, we have ceased sourcing from QL Group of companies where the last purchase was in November 2019. Several meetings have taken place since then to guide QL Group of companies to the compliance of NDPE policy and meeting the re-entry criteria.A field visit to PT PMI was conducted in January 2020 to assess the situation on the ground and develop an action plan for PT PMI to close the gaps identified during the field visit. In April 2020, QL Group has met all the criteria stipulated in the re-entry criteria, including their commitment to the development of Recovery Plan for Non-Compliant Land Clearing in line with the NDPE policy at group level incurred from January 2016 onwards.Based on detailed review of documentation, reports and letter of commitment from QL Group, the Wilmar Suspension Committee gave due consideration of this progress and lifted the suspension on QL Group in April 2020. In 2020, PT PMI developed a recovery plan that focused on the rehabilitation of river buffers, conservation of unplanted areas, and training on firefighting and fire prevention for local communities. PT PMI began the implementation of this recovery initiative since October 2021. In June 2023, Wilmar conducted a field visit to PT PMI to assess the progress of the recovery plan. The visit confirmed that PT PMI has established the nursery, installed river buffer signboards, carried out active planting of 622 tree seedlings, and conducted outreach on firefighting and fire prevention for the local community.",http://www.mightyearth.org/wp-content/uploads/Rapid-Response-Report-21_final_v2.pdf,

409,Wilmar International,,Closed,11/11/2014,,,,,Rainforest Action Network (RAN),Multiple Suppliers (Leuser Ecosystem),,,,Alleged threats to the biodiversity of Leuser Ecosystem Potential forest clearance and impacts on biodiversity,"A meeting was held with RAN on 19 November 2014 to discuss the report and understand the issues raised by RAN. Wilmar has identified mills in its supply chain which might be at risk of sourcing fresh fruits bunches (FFB) illegally from the Leuser Ecosystem, and completed a risk assessment on those mills. Following the said risk assessments, dialogues with high priority suppliers commenced and the risk assessment was used to facilitate field assessments with those suppliers with the aim of achieving full compliance with Wilmar’s Policy. This process is known as the Aggregator Refinery Transformation (ART) plan, a collective and regional approach to addressing supplier non-compliance. It is a more effective way to drive transformation and effect real change on the ground; a detailed explanation on our ART plan is available on our website: https://www.wilmar-international.com/sustainability/supply-chain-transformation Progress updates are available here. As part of our ART programme, we have: 1) identified and conducted field assessments on high priority suppliers supplying to our Kuala Tanjung refinery and Paya Pasir kernel crushing plant which included those operating in and around the Leuser Ecosystem. We visited 14 third-party supplier mills and one Wilmar mill in 2015. 2) Consolidated the findings and summarised them into an anonymised report known as the ""Overarching Report"" for sharing with all suppliers supplying into that refinery and kernel crushing plant. The report was uploaded on our website in June 2016: https://www.wilmar-international.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/highlights/sustainability/2016/07/kuala-tanjung-and-paya-pasir-refinery-overarching-report-english-final.pdf?sfvrsn=30842157_2 3) Shared the findings of the assessments and recommendations on improvements with our suppliers from that region through a workshop, which was held in Medan in October 2016. Wilmar also organised a series of one-day regional-specific trainings in 2017, which were open to all of our suppliers and their suppliers, as well as any interested growers in the region. The trainings were focused on the following topics: I. Environment – land use planning/ management, HCS/HCV, peat management and environmental impact management. II. Fair Labour Practices - Employment Contracts, Child Labour, Access to Remedy, Freedom of Association, Harassment, etc. III Community – Conflict Resolution, FPIC, Land Tenure, Social Impact. On 15 December 2016, Wilmar announced its commitment to addressing the deforestation challenge in the Leuser Ecosystem by becoming part of an existing multi-stakeholder process involving the Aceh Singkil and Aceh Tamiang governments, two districts within the Leuser Ecosystem under the “Areal Prioritas Transformasi (APT)” program. This process was in collaboration with GAR, Musim Mas, as well as Apical, TFT and IDH. More information on Wilmar’s Collaborative Landscape Approach can be found here. In July 2020, we rolled out the Leuser Supplier Reporting Tool (LSRT) to all our direct suppliers operating within the 50km radius of the Leuser Ecosystem, where our suppliers were required to fill in a series of questions related to their operations and sourcing practices. We have also shared the list of high risk plantations operating in the region with these direct suppliers, and sought their response on their exposure to those high risk companies. Suppliers who declined to participate in this programme have already been removed from our supply chain, where we can only resume purchase after they have completed the said questionnaire. So far, all our direct suppliers operating within a 50km radius from the Leuser Ecosystem has confirmed that they are not sourcing from the identified high risk companies within the Leuser Ecosystem. A follow-up webinar has also been conducted for the suppliers and their FFB suppliers on 4 November 2020, to raise their awareness on the importance of protecting the Leuser Ecosystem through NDPE commitments. Apart from Wilmar, key speakers included Mr. M. Daud, S. Hut as Head of Protection and Conservation of Natural Resources, Environmental Service (Kabid Perlindungan dan Konservasi Sumber Daya Alam, Dinas Lingkungan Hidup), Mr. Rudi Putra, Advisor of Forum Konservasi Leuser, and a representative from a FMCG company.

We have voluntarily raised this as a grievance in order to be transparent and accountable to all stakeholders and to share the findings of our investigations, and the actions we have taken to mitigate issues which have been identified. In August 2016, we conducted internal assessment in the subsidiaries in question and work is underway to resolve the issues. The assessment report is available here. Subsequent to our internal report, Amnesty International published a report “The Great Palm Oil Scandal” with similar findings on 30 November 2016. We have also initiated an internal review process which is still ongoing: Date Process Location 10 August 2016 Received information on labour-related issues PT Daya Labuhan Indah (DLI), PT Perkebunan Milano (PM) 12 August – 2 September 2016 Initial assessment and consultations to verify the issue PT DLI, PT PM September – October 2016 Conducted an inquiry into wage practices with the Human Resources (HR) Department of PT DLI and checked against the local government regulations on wages, PP No. 78/2015 (replacing PP No. 8/1981) to ensure compliance Wilmar head office and regional office November 2016 Planned 2nd assessment to monitor and check on progress PT DLI, PT PM December 2016 Planned site visit with BSR and Wilmar internal team in North Sumatra PT PM January 2017 Planned site visit with BSR and Wilmar internal team in Central Kalimantan PT Mustika Sembuluh (PT MS) Some of the identified issues are common challenges shared by the industry, and we seek to address and improve labour practices through our collaboration with Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), to review current labour practices in the palm oil sector in Indonesia. More information about our collaboration with BSR can be found here. Our internal team has completed the second assessment from 28 November - 2 December 2016. The assessment report is available here. BSR has completed field assessments in PT PM and PT DLI from 12-15 December 2016. The assessment methodology involved visual observations, interviews, focus group discussions, and documentation review. Over 100 employees, mostly non-management workers, were interviewed by BSR. More information on the preliminary findings of the independent assessment can be found here. The BSR public report was finally delivered to Wilmar in end March 2017; the report is available here. Following the field assessments on PT PM and PT DLI in North Sumatra in December 2016, BSR has also completed assessment on PT Mustika Sembuluh (MS) in Central Kalimantan in January 2017. The methodology adopted by the independent assessor is similar to the one used in North Sumatra, which included interviewing a total of 56 non-management workers without the presence of management personnel. The preliminary findings of the assessment is enclosed here. The full report by BSR on PT MS will follow As part of our investigation process, we have met with union representatives from Serikat Pekerja Seluruh Indonesia and Serbundo on 9 Jan 2017. The meeting was to clarify labour issues in PT Milano and PT DLI, and to seek feedback and suggestions. In addition to the assessments by BSR, PT PM has also undergone a two-day independent assessment by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) in early February 2017. Please contact the Wilmar Grievance Manager In addition to the assessments by BSR, PT PM has also undergone a two-day independent assessment by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) in early February 2017. Please contact the Wilmar Grievance Manager (grievance_procedure@wilmar.com.sg) directly for more information on the ISCC assessment. Based on report, some of the key findings include: “That no children are present on the plantation to help their parents”, “That the workers are not paid a minimum wage on the basis of achieving a target in terms of tons FFB, number of sprayed tanks or number of fertilizer bags applied to the land” “That the minimum monthly wage is always paid to permanent workers regardless of their performance” “That non-permanent workers are paid 90,000 IDR (= min. wage) even if they don’t achieve their targets.” A compilation of findings and our action plan are summarized from both our internal assessments, as well as external assessments completed by Business for Social Responsibility (BSR), Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC). We released the action plans in April 2017 and we reported our progress in June 2017. On 13 June 2017, Wilmar met with Amnesty International to discuss the action plan and progress. We are committed to providing regular updates to Amnesty International on our progress of implementing our action plan. In August 2017, Verité conducted ground verification for risk mapping and development of action plan followed by publishing the Post-Ground Verification Progress Report. In December 2017, Wilmar released a One Year Progress Update on Labour Review and Improvement Programme. This provides information on the improvements Wilmar has put in place over the last year including the progress on the work undertaken in collaboration with Verité. In February 2018, Wilmar provided further updates on a wide range of initiatives to provide a better and more conducive environment for our employees to live and work in. As a continuation of our engagement with Amnesty International, a meeting was held in Amnesty International’s office in London, on 18 June 2018. In the meeting, we have provided updates to Amnesty International on our progress in implementing our action plan and challenges we faced on the ground. We have committed to strengthen our efforts, specifically on the procedures in providing remediation to workers and address the concern of suitability of PPE for tropical country. We will continue to provide regular updates to Amnesty International on the various programmes we have put in place, including our collaboration with our peers in the Decent Rural Living Initiative and our collaboration with Verite. In February 2020, Verité conducted final verification audit to assess the condition on the ground for further improvement. The assessment covered one (1) mill and two (2) estates each from the Milano and DLI sites. A total of 56 management representatives (35 in Milano, 21 in DLI) and 130 workers (54 in Milano, 76 in DLI) from the mills and estates were interviewed. In addition, a total of 37 other stakeholders (26 in Milano, 11 in DLI) were interviewed; these stakeholders consist of clinic personnel, union officers, child care personnel, cooperative officers, gender committee officers, women’s working group staff, school teachers, smallholders, transportation suppliers, and public relations. Documents and records such as, but not limited to policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs), personnel files, pay records, time records were also reviewed. Closing meetings were held at the end of the assessment for each site, during which findings, risks, and observations were presented to and discussed with management personnel. Verite’s summary of findings from July 2020 of PT Milano and PT DLI’s three year sustainability plan is available here.

Wawasan Kebun Nusantara",,,,,"Greenpeace shared with Wilmar, information on 16 companies with alleged non-compliance to NDPE requirements. The case report provided some details on deforestation allegations, such as map outlines and names of concessions. PT GAN, PT APM and PT ACP, which were allegedly owned or associated with ‘GAMA Group’ were identified to have been involved in deforestation activities. [For more details, please refer to the Grievance Case allegedly linked to GAMA Group on PT GAN, PT APM and PT ACP filed on 13 Dec 2017] The case report has also identified six Wilmar’s suppliers with links to the “GAMA Group” allegations. These suppliers are: - PT Citra Riau Sarana - PT Ganda Sawit Utama (PT Jatimjaya Perkasa, TH Indo Plantations) - PT Inecda & PT Gandaerah Hendana - PT Patiware - PT Tritunggal Sentral Buana - PT Wawasan Kebun Nusantara Wilmar wrote to the above six suppliers individually requesting clarification of the allegations. All the suppliers have responded in writing in early June 2017 that they are not associated with PT GAN, PT APM and PT ACP. In the same letter, the suppliers have also committed to NDPE Policy, specifically on: ▪ Moratorium on all Land Clearing in our concession. ▪ No development on High Carbon Stock (HCS) forests. ▪ No development on High Conservation Value (HCV) areas. ▪ No new development on Peat areas, regardless of depth While Wilmar is seeking more clarity on the GAMA’s ownership, we have ceased sourcing from the above six companies as of 22 June 2018. In October 2018, after due investigation and reviewing evidences submitted by PT Inecda and PT Gandaerah Hendana, it is confirmed that GAMA has no management control on these two companies. Samsung C&T as the major shareholder has been solely managing these companies since 2008. Wilmar therefore has lifted its suspension on PT Inecda and PT Gandaerah Hendana . On 10 August 2018, GAMA Plantation and Aidenvironment signed a statement on their collaboration in developing and implementing a sustainability Policy. To be able to implement the Sustainability Polic, GAMA plantation voluntarily consolidated as a ""Group"" under a single management. All entities under GAMA's management shall follow the Group's Sustainability Policy, that presently covers 27 companies with 29 plantations units. The Group operates 20 mills and has a total planted area of nearly 200,000 hectares in Sumatera, Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Papua. A comprehensive Sustainability Policy was released in September 2018 and followed by its first progress in February 2019 report detailing the implementation and progress of their NDPE policy commitments. Based on detailed review of documentation, reports, and gestational from GAMA Plantation group, and after consultation with Aidenvironment on the group's performance and overall commitment - the Wilmar Suspension Committee have given due consideration of this progress and have lifted the suspension in March 2019.

A further meeting was held with EHP on 8 July 2015 wherein EHP agreed to a moratorium on landclearing activities in PT VMA. EHP has engaged a reputable HCS assessor to conduct the HCS assessments. A few more meetings were held with EHP thereafter. The HCS assessments were completed in 2016; as a result almost 50% of PT VMA’s concession will need to be conserved. The full report has completed the HCSA peer review, and the summary report and the peer review feedback can be found here. On 27 September 2016, Wilmar received a new report from Greenpeace alleging deforestation by PT Arrtu Energie Resources (PT AER) and exploitations in PT Tandan Sawita Papua (PT TSP). Report is available here (http://www.greenpeace.nl/Global/nederland/report/2016/bossen/Deadly-Trade-off-IOI-Report.pdf) Dialogue was immediately initiated with EHP to seek clarifications on the allegations. EHP issued the following statement responding to the report: http://www.eaglehighplantations.com/media-center/news-views/161-october-2016.html A meeting was further held with EHP on 8 November 2016, where Wilmar sought further clarification on the allegations. According to EHP, the deforestation in PT AER was carried out by surrounding communities. In order to avoid similar incident from recurring, EHP has committed to conduct land tenure study. EHP is also in the process of enhancing its firefighting effort to prevent similar fire incidences from occuring in their concessions in the future. With regards to the allegations of exploitation at PT TSP, the chronology of events on the labour dispute and the shooting incident was shared by EHP. EHP was also in the process of seeking official statement from the authority to support the clarifications. A follow up meeting was held on 4 April 2019 to obtain updates on the various issues raised against PT VMA, PT AER and PT TSP. EHP clarified that that no new development has taken place in PT VMA, and presented information on its conservation project i.e. “AMOUR” (Arrtu, Mayak, Orangutan Rescue), which is located on an area of 4,000 ha within PT AER. The AMOUR project is aimed at protecting and restoring the habitats of orang utan in the PT AER’s HCV areas. Additionally, EHP has also worked to Rimba Raya and Yasiwa to develop other conservation programmes in Central Kalimantan and in East Kalimantan, respectively. On PT TSP’s case, EHP updated that third party auditors have conducted site visit between 11 to 13 January 2019 to assess and verify the allegations reported by Greenpeace. According to the findings of the audit report: (i) the palm oil development within PT TSP that took place between 2011 to 2013 was carried out in accordance to the HCV and SIA reports, and (ii) on the allegations related to labour, the audit report concluded that PT TSP complied with RSPO P&C requirements. Supporting documentation was also shared by EHP and these corroborated the clarifications provided to Wilmar.",http://www.greenomics.org/docs/IPOP_Implementation_Report-05_Greenomics.pdf,

Our supplier, Jernih Kemboja, however is implicated due to their association with AA Sawit. Wilmar immediately initiated engagement with Jernih Kemboja when allegations of deforestation at PTD 4882, 4085, 4963, 4118, 4177 and 4121 by AA Sawit was brought to our attention in July 2022. A field investigation was carried in August 2022 to verify the allegations. Our field investigation as well as LUCA analysis on their concession maps thereafter has confirmed that there is non-compliance to the No Deforestation commitment to the NDPE Policy. Wilmar’s last purchase from this supplier was in September 2022. As of October 2023, Jernih Kemboja has met all the requirements stipulated in our re-entry criteria. This includes their commitment to the development of a Recovery Plan for Non-Compliant Land Clearing to the NDPE policy at group level, for activity that has taken place from January 2016 onwards. Based on the detailed review of documentation, reports and a letter of commitment from Jernih Kemboja, the Wilmar Suspension Committee has given due consideration of this progress and lifted the suspension of Jernih Kemboja in October 2023.",https://www.mightyearth.org/wp-content/uploads/RR-Report-40_draft_vers-b.pdf,
