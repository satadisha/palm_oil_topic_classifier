See the following news link:3/1/22: Atthe end of H2 2021, we evaluated the progress of the PT AP case as planned. Based on our assessment, PT AP has fulfilled all the points outlined in the action plan agreed. PT AP has resumed operations n the 180 Ha disputed area. This is aftera series of informal mediation efforts which led to the the local communities (in Pagar Batu Village) who were involved in the incidentunderstandingand acceptingthe fact that the area is legally owned and controlled by PT AP until the HGU title expires. The mediation process was facilitated/supported by the local NGOs who are considered credible by the local communities. The local communities now welcome PT AP's operation in the area, and someof them are also working for PT AP. The complainant/grievance raiser has acknowledged this development and based on our monitoring there have been no further claims made or conflicts reported in the public domain since April 2021. We will keep monitoring the progress and keep our stakeholders updated. As part of long-term support, GAR has a plan to provide PT AP with FPIC training in the near future.
